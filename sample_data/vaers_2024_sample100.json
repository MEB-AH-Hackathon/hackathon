One day at work I started to get extremely hot, started running a fever, sweating, nausea, dizziness and then a sharp pain. The golf ball size welp in my arm exploded. I was rushed to the emergency room. They gave me liquids, pain medications and ran some tests. I told them about the welp, the vaccine and how the welp decreased in size in less than 5 hours.

The events \"bone pain\", \"could barely walk\" and \"could barely move around\" required physician office visit. Therapeutic measures were not taken as a result of bone pain, gait disturbance, movement disorder.  Additional information: The patient reported she had been receiving Moderna products. And never got sick with Moderna, not once. She was high risk patient, also had a handicap son who lived with her. The patient wore diabetic sensor. The pharmacist gave her both injections in same arm, the Moderna COVID vaccine and the Prevnar 20. On 09Mar2024, the patient was okay. On 10Mar2024, thought every bone in her body was broken. She could barely walk, could barely move around, never had such pain in her life. It was in her thighs, calves, feet, back, hips, arms, she reported never felt such bone pain in her entire life. She did not really know what to make of it so just kind of took her cane, thought maybe it would wear out the following day; it was more centralized in hip area. First noticed the bone pain when she went to get out bed. Went to stand up, everything, hurt so much, could not even stand it. Clarified, bone pain in lower feet, lower back, arms, all bones. The following day, on 11Mar2024, it was gone, only thing left was in hip areas, hip joints. On 12Mar2024, she was finally good, she pretty much recovered completely from it, took it easy, it did not come back.  She did not know if it was because they gave both those injections too close together, physically, both in same arm. She reported not taking treatment, not a lot she could had taken since she did not know what it was. Normally, she did not even get 1 headache a year. Only thing she had in medicine cabinet was aspirin, paracetamol, caffeine (EXTRA STRENGTH EXCEDRIN), acetaminophen (TYLENOL) and naproxen sodium (ALEVE), she was tempted to take naproxen sodium, but didn't know what was going to happen.

The patient's relevant medical history included: \"Alzheimer's\" (unspecified if ongoing); \"vascular\" (unspecified if ongoing). There were no concomitant medications. The following information was reported: DEPRESSED MOOD (non-serious) with onset 2021, outcome \"unknown\", described as \"went down hill\"; VASCULAR DEMENTIA (death), outcome \"fatal\"; INFLAMMATION (death), outcome \"fatal\", described as \"extra inflammation\"; CEREBROVASCULAR DISORDER (death), outcome \"fatal\", described as \"some increase maybe in vascular part of brain\"; MIXED DEMENTIA (death), outcome \"fatal\", described as \"passed away from mixed dementia\".

It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. Caller noted this with other study, may be a coincidence, may not, but patient went down hill very fast. Patient got first COVID vaccine in Feb2021, when first available, then went down hill very quickly, more from vascular dementia, and then passed away 01Aug2022, and so is possible that it caused some increase maybe in vascular part of brain, that extra inflammation or whatever vaccine did.
