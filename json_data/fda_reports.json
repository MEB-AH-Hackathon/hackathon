The irritative side effects are usually seen following the third instillation, and tend to increase in severity after each administration.\n\nThe irritative bladder adverse effects can usually be managed symptomatically with products such as pyridium, propantheline bromide, oxybutynin chloride and acetaminophen. The mechanism of action of the irritative side effects has not been firmly established, but is most consistent with an immunological mechanism.3 There is no evidence that dose reduction or antituberculous drug therapy can prevent or lessen the irritative toxicity of TICE\u00ae BCG.\n\n\"Flu-like\" symptoms (malaise, fever, and chills) which may accompany the localized, irritative toxicities often reflect hypersensitivity reactions which can be treated symptomatically. Antihistamines have also been used.5\n\nAdverse reactions to TICE\u00ae BCG tend to be progressive in frequency and severity with subsequent instillation. Delay or postponement of subsequent treatment may or may not reduce the severity of a reaction during subsequent instillation."

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 1.7% of recipients of ROTARIX (n = 36,755) as compared with 1.9% of placebo recipients (n = 34,454). Among placebo recipients, diarrhea (placebo 0.07%, ROTARIX 0.02%), dehydration (placebo 0.06%, ROTARIX 0.02%), and gastroenteritis (placebo 0.3%, ROTARIX 0.2%) occurred at a statistically higher incidence (95% CI of RR excluding 1) as compared with recipients of ROTARIX. In a controlled safety study (Study 8) conducted in Latin America and Finland, the risk of intussusception was evaluated in 63,225 infants (31,673 received ROTARIX and 31,552 received placebo). No increased risk of intussusception following administration of ROTARIX was observed within a 31-day period following any dose, and rates were comparable to the placebo group after a median of 100 days. Among vaccine recipients, there were no confirmed cases of intussusception within the 0- to 14-day period after the first dose."
