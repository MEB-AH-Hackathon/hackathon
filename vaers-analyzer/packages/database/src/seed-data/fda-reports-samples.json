In these studies, a total of 22,924 subjects 6 through 16 years of age received at least one dose of DENGVAXIA and 10,668 received placebo (0.9% sodium chloride). Solicited adverse reactions were recorded daily for 14 days following each vaccination. The most frequently reported adverse reactions regardless of the dengue serostatus prior to vaccination in ages 9 through 16 years were headache (40%), injection site pain (32%), malaise (25%), asthenia (25%), and myalgia (29%). The most frequently reported adverse reactions regardless of the dengue serostatus prior to vaccination in ages 6 through 8 years were headache (27%), injection site pain (28%), malaise (19%), asthenia (13%), and myalgia (15%).",
