    "SYMPTOM_TEXT": "When given the vaccine it immediately started burning and feeling like fire was injected into my arms. I then proceeded to get extremely hot and dizzy, the nurses had me wait longer than usual to make sure the effects didn't worsen before leaving. Once I left I proceeded to have pain in my right arms for days. I saw my doctor again and told him about the pain and had him feel the marble size welt that formed in my arm. I told him it was from the vaccine and he denied it, and said it was nothing to worry about and probably a bruise. The welp proceeded to get bigger and cause me pain to where I couldn't use my arm in less than a week. Before I knew it, it was the size of a golf ball in my right arm. One day at work I started to get extremely hot, started running a fever, sweating, nausea, dizziness and then a sharp pain. The golf ball size welp in my arm exploded. I was rushed to the emergency room. They gave me liquids, pain medications and ran some tests. I told them about the welp, the vaccine and how the welp decreased in size in less than 5 hours. The doctor denied that the cause for my symptoms would have anything to do with that. But yet the doctor said I was fine and nothing was wrong and sent me away within a few hours.",
