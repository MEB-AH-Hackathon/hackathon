DENGVAXIA is approved for \nuse in individuals 6 through 16 years of age with laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection \nand living in endemic areas. \nLimitations of use \n• \nDENGVAXIA is not approved for use in individuals younger than 6 years of age. These \nindividuals, regardless of previous infection by dengue virus, are at increased risk of severe \nand hospitalized dengue disease following vaccination with DENGVAXIA and subsequent \ninfection with any dengue virus serotype. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] \n \n• DENGVAXIA is not approved for use in individuals not previously infected by any dengue \nvirus serotype or for whom this information is unknown. Those not previously infected are \nat increased risk for severe dengue disease when vaccinated and subsequently infected with \ndengue virus. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]  Previous dengue infection can be \nassessed through a medical record of a previous laboratory-confirmed dengue infection or \nthrough serological testing prior to vaccination. \n• The safety and effectiveness of DENGVAXIA have not been established in individuals \nliving in dengue nonendemic areas who travel to dengue endemic areas. \n2 \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  \nFor subcutaneous use only.  \n2.1 \nDose  \nThree doses (0.5 mL each) 6 months apart (at month 0, 6, and 12). \n2.2 \nPreparation  \nThe package contains a vial of lyophilized vaccine antigen and a vial of saline diluent (0.4% \nNaCl). \nAfter removing the “flip-off” caps, cleanse the lyophilized vaccine antigen and diluent vial \nstoppers with a suitable germicide. Do not remove the vial stoppers or metal seals holding them \nin place.  \nTo reconstitute DENGVAXIA, use a sterile needle and syringe to withdraw 0.6 mL from the \ndiluent vial and inject it into the vial of the lyophilized vaccine antigen. Swirl the vial gently.  \n \n3 \n \nChanging needles between withdrawing the vaccine from the vial and injecting it into a recipient \nis not necessary unless the needle has been damaged or contaminated. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \nInsert the syringe needle \nthrough the stopper of \nthe vial of diluent and \nwithdraw 0.6 mL liquid \ncontent. \n \nFigure 2 \nInsert the syringe needle \nthrough the stopper of \nthe vial of lyophilized \nvaccine antigen and \ninject the liquid into the \nvial. \nFigure 3 \nSwirl vial gently. The syringe \nneedle is not removed while \nswirling the vial. \nFigure 4 \nAfter reconstitution, \nwithdraw 0.5 mL.  \nDENGVAXIA should \nbe used immediately \nafter reconstitution. \nAfter reconstitution, the suspension is colorless and may develop trace amounts of white to \ntranslucent endogenous proteinaceous particles. [See Description (11).] \nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration \nprior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Discard the vial if the solution is \ncloudy or contains particles other than trace amounts of white to translucent particles.  \nDiscard reconstituted vaccine if not used within 30 minutes. [See How Supplied/Storage and \nHandling (16.2).] \nDENGVAXIA should not be mixed in the same syringe with other parenteral products. \n2.3 \nAdministration  \nAfter reconstitution, withdraw 0.5 mL of DENGVAXIA and administer subcutaneously \nimmediately or store refrigerated at 2C to 8C (36F to 46F) and use within 30 minutes. Do not \nadminister DENGVAXIA by intramuscular injection. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nDENGVAXIA is a suspension for injection (supplied as a lyophilized powder to be reconstituted \nwith the supplied diluent, 0.4% NaCl). A single dose, after reconstitution, is 0.5 mL. \n \n4 \n \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity  \nDo not administer DENGVAXIA to individuals with a history of severe allergic reaction to a \nprevious dose of DENGVAXIA or to any component of DENGVAXIA. [See Description (11).] \n4.2 \nImmunocompromised Individuals  \nDo not administer DENGVAXIA to individuals with severe immunodeficiency or \nimmunosuppression due to disease or therapy. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nIncreased Risk of Severe Dengue Disease Following DENGVAXIA in \nPersons Younger than 6 Years of Age Regardless of Previous Infection with \nDengue Virus  \nDENGVAXIA is not approved for use in individuals younger than 6 years of age. In persons \nyounger than 6 years of age regardless of previous infection by dengue virus, an increased risk of \nsevere and hospitalized dengue disease can occur following vaccination with DENGVAXIA and \nsubsequent infection with any dengue virus serotype. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] \n5.2 \nIncreased Risk of Severe Dengue Disease Following DENGVAXIA in \nPersons of Any Age Not Previously Infected with Dengue Virus  \nIn unvaccinated individuals, first dengue infections rarely cause severe dengue, while second \ndengue infections with a different serotype are associated with an increased risk of severe \ndengue. DENGVAXIA administration to individuals not previously infected by dengue virus is \nassociated with an increased risk of severe dengue disease when the vaccinated individual is \nsubsequently infected with any dengue virus serotype. Therefore, healthcare professionals must \nevaluate individuals for prior dengue infection to avoid vaccinating individuals who have not \nbeen previously infected by dengue virus.  \nPrevious infection by dengue virus can be evaluated through a medical record of previous \nlaboratory-confirmed dengue infection or through serotesting prior to vaccination. \nThere is no FDA cleared test available to determine a previous dengue infection. Available \nnon-FDA cleared tests may yield false positive results (e.g., due to cross-reactivity with other \nflaviviruses).  \n5.3 Management of Acute Allergic Reactions  \nDENGVAXIA may cause hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Appropriate medical \ntreatment and supervision must be available following administration of DENGVAXIA. \n5.4 \nLimitations of Vaccine Effectiveness  \nVaccination with DENGVAXIA may not protect all individuals. It is recommended to continue \npersonal protection measures against mosquito bites after vaccination. \n \n5 \n \n5.5 \nSyncope  \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, vaccination with DENGVAXIA as a \npsychogenic response to injection with a needle. Procedures should be in place to prevent injury \nfrom falling and to manage syncopal reactions. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.  \nThe safety of DENGVAXIA in subjects 6 through 16 years of age was evaluated in 12  \nrandomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials with at least 28 days of follow-up \nconducted primarily in dengue endemic regions including Asia-Pacific and Latin American \ncountries. In these studies, a total of 22,924 subjects 6 through 16 years of age received at least \none dose of DENGVAXIA and 10,668 received placebo (0.9% sodium chloride). Overall, 51.6% \nof trial participants who received DENGVAXIA or placebo were female. Racial groups were \nreported as 27% Asian, 11.9% American Indian or Alaska native, 5.8% Caucasian, 2.3% black, \nand 53% as other. In the largest study (Study 1, NCT01374516; N = 20,869) conducted in four \nLatin American countries and Puerto Rico, most subjects (99.9%) reported Hispanic ethnicity. \nAll studies enrolled subjects irrespective of evidence of previous dengue infection. \nSolicited Adverse Reactions \nIn two multi-center, observer-blind, randomized (2:1), placebo-controlled trials conducted in \nfour Latin American countries and Puerto Rico (Study 1, NCT01374516; subjects 9 through 16 \nyears of age) and in five Asia-Pacific countries (Study 2, NCT01373281; subjects 6 through 14 \nyears of age), 2,000 subjects in Study 1 and 1,310 subjects in Study 2 (out of a total of 20,869 \nsubjects and 10,278 subjects respectively) were recruited during the first 2 months of enrollment \nfor inclusion in the reactogenicity subset. Solicited adverse reactions were recorded daily for 14 \ndays following each vaccination. \nTable 1 and Table 2 present the frequency and severity of solicited injection site reactions \nreported within 7 days and systemic adverse reactions reported within 14 days following receipt \nof DENGVAXIA or placebo. \n \n6 \n \nTable 1: Percentages of Subjects with Solicited Injection Site Reactions within 7 Days and \nSystemic Adverse Reactions within 14 Days Following Receipt of Each Dose of \nDENGVAXIA or Placebo in Children and Adolescents 9 through 16 Years of Age in \nStudy 1 \n \nDose 1 \nDose 2 \nDose 3 \nDENGVAXIA \n% \nN = 1,264-\n1,326 \nPlacebo \n% \nN = \n635-657 \nDENGVAXIA \n% \nN = 1,228-\n1,298 \nPlacebo \n% \nN = \n594-639 \nDENGVAXIA \n% \nN = 1,215-\n1,279 \nPlacebo \n% \nN =  \n597-631 \nInjection Site Reactions \nPain* \n \nAny \nGrade 3 \n32.4 \n0.8 \n26.3 \n0.9 \n25.6 \n0.5 \n16.4 \n0.0 \n22.5 \n0.9 \n16.5 \n0.3 \nErythema† \n \nAny \nGrade 3 \n4.1 \n0.0 \n4.7 \n0.2 \n1.9 \n<0.1 \n1.7 \n0.0 \n1.5 \n0.0 \n1.6 \n0.0 \nSwelling† \n \nAny \nGrade 3 \n3.5 \n0.0 \n2.7 \n0.2 \n1.9 \n0.0 \n0.9 \n0.0 \n1.6 \n0.0 \n1.3 \n0.0 \nSystemic Adverse Reactions \n \n \nAsthenia‡ \n \nAny \nGrade 3 \n24.6 \n2.7 \n22.5 \n2.6 \n17.8 \n1.8 \n16.4 \n1.1 \n16.3 \n1.3 \n17.4 \n1.3 \nFever§ \n \nAny \nGrade 3 \n6.8 \n1.7 \n6.6 \n1.1 \n5.9 \n0.8 \n7.1 \n1.2 \n7.3 \n1.1 \n8.7 \n0.8 \nHeadache‡ \n \nAny \nGrade 3 \n39.9 \n5.1 \n41.6 \n4.1 \n29.8 \n2.1 \n28.5 \n2.3 \n29.6 \n2.6 \n25.0 \n1.9 \nMalaise‡ \n \nAny \nGrade 3 \n24.5 \n2.4 \n25.9 \n2.3 \n20.8 \n1.3 \n16.6 \n1.3 \n19.3 \n1.4 \n15.2 \n1.1 \nMyalgia‡ \n \nAny \nGrade 3 \n29.2 \n2.2 \n27.4 \n1.5 \n21.0 \n1.6 \n15.8 \n0.8 \n20.0 \n1.5 \n18.4 \n0.8 \nN: range number of subjects with available data for the specified endpoints \nStudy 1, NCT01374516 \nPlacebo: 0.9% sodium chloride \n*  For subjects 9 through 11 years of age – Grade 3: Incapacitating, unable to perform usual activities.

A subset of \n3,203 subjects (80.1%) enrolled in Study 3 were re-consented to participate in an extension study \nto evaluate safety of DENGVAXIA for 72 months (Study 4, NCT01983553). A total of 21,295 \nchildren and adolescents 6 through 16 years of age enrolled in these trials received at least one \ndose of DENGVAXIA. Table 3 presents the incidences and hazard ratios of severe dengue from \nmonth 13 to month -72 post vaccination with DENGVAXIA or placebo in children and \nadolescents 6 through 16 years of age, by dengue baseline serostatus. An increased rate of severe \ndengue was observed following vaccination with DENGVAXIA and subsequent infection with \nany dengue virus serotype in persons not previously infected by dengue virus.

The following events were \nconsidered related to DENGVAXIA: asthma attack (day of Dose 1), urticaria (day of Dose 2), \nconvulsion (day of Dose 1) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (7 days post Dose 1).  \nIn the 12 studies with subjects monitored for 6 months after the last dose, the proportions of \nsubjects who reported at least 1 non-fatal SAE after 28 days and up to 6 months after any dose \nwere similar in the 2 groups: 3.2% in the DENGVAXIA group (728/22,924) and 3.8% in the \nplacebo group (404/10,668). None of these SAEs were considered related to the vaccination.  \nDeaths \nFrom the first administered dose up to month 72, 53 deaths (0.2%) for subjects who received \nDENGVAXIA and 34 deaths (0.3 %) for subjects who received placebo were reported in 9 of the \n12 studies conducted among subjects 6 though 16 years of age with at least 6 months follow-up. \nNone of the deaths were considered related to vaccination. Causes of death among subjects were \nconsistent with those generally reported in children and adolescent populations.  \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience  \nIn addition to events reported in clinical trials for DENGVAXIA, the following adverse events \nhave been spontaneously reported during postapproval use. Because these events are reported \nvoluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their \nfrequency or establish a causal relationship to the vaccine.  \nThe following adverse events were included based on one or more of the following factors: \nseverity, frequency of reporting, or strength of evidence for a causal relationship to \nDENGVAXIA. \nImmune system disorders \nAllergic including anaphylactic reactions. \nInfections and infestations \nSevere dengue infection, including hospitalization and death, in individuals for whom \ndengue infection status prior to vaccination was unknown and who were subsequently \ninfected with dengue following vaccination. \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 \nImmunosuppressive Treatments  \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic \ndrugs and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune \nresponse to DENGVAXIA.  \nsanofi pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n323 – DENGVAXIA® \n \n \n11 \n \n7.2 \nDrug/Laboratory Test Interactions  \nDENGVAXIA may cause temporary depression of tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) \ntest sensitivity, leading to false negative results. Tuberculin testing should be performed before \nDENGVAXIA is administered or at least 1 month following vaccination with DENGVAXIA. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.1 \nPregnancy  \nPregnancy Exposure Registry \nThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to \nDENGVAXIA during pregnancy. Women who receive DENGVAXIA during pregnancy are \nencouraged to contact directly, or have their healthcare professional contact, Sanofi Pasteur Inc. \nat 1-800-822-2463 (1-800-VACCINE) to enroll in or obtain information about the registry. \nRisk Summary \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general \npopulation, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically \nrecognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.  \nNo specific studies of DENGVAXIA have been performed among pregnant women. A limited \nnumber of cases of inadvertent exposure during pregnancy were reported during clinical studies. \nIsolated adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., stillbirth, intrauterine death, spontaneous abortion, \nblighted ovum) have been observed for these exposed pregnancies, with similar frequency and \nnature in the vaccinated individuals compared to the control group, and with risk factors \nidentified for all cases. Available data in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine the \neffects of DENGVAXIA on pregnancy, embryo-fetal development, parturition and postnatal \ndevelopment.  \nIn two developmental toxicity studies, the effect of DENGVAXIA on embryo-fetal and postnatal \ndevelopment was evaluated in pregnant rabbits and mice. A developmental toxicity study was \nperformed in female rabbits given a 5 log10 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID50) of \nDENGVAXIA (full human dose ranging from 4.5 log10 to 6.0 log10 CCID50) by intravenous \ninjection prior to mating and during gestation. The study revealed no evidence of harm to the \nfetus due to DENGVAXIA. In another study, female mice were administered a single dose of 5 \nlog10 CCID50, 6.5 log10 CCID50 (about 3 times the highest human dose) or 8 log10 CCID50 (about \n100 times the highest human dose) of DENGVAXIA by intravenous injection during gestation. \nFetal toxicities were observed at maternally toxic doses. [See Animal Data (8.1).] \nClinical Considerations \nDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk  \nPregnant women are at increased risk of complications associated with dengue infection \ncompared to non-pregnant women. Pregnant women with dengue may be at increased risk for \nsanofi pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n323 – DENGVAXIA® \n \n \n12 \n \nadverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm labor and delivery. Vertical transmission of \ndengue virus from mothers with viremia at delivery to their infants has been reported. \nFetal/neonatal adverse reactions \nVaccine viremia can occur 7 to 14 days after vaccination with a duration of <7 days [See \nPharmacokinetics (12.3).]. The potential for transmission of the vaccine virus from mother to \ninfant is unknown.  \nAnimal Data \nIn two developmental toxicity studies, the effect of DENGVAXIA on embryo-fetal and postnatal \ndevelopment was evaluated in pregnant rabbits and mice.  \nRabbits were administered a full human dose [0.5 mL (5 log10 CCID50/animal/occasion)] of \nDENGVAXIA by intravenous injection 30 and 10 days before mating and on Days 6, 12 and 27 \nduring gestation. No vaccine-related fetal malformation or variations and adverse effects on \nfemale fertility or preweaning development were reported in this study. Pregnant mice were \nadministered a single dose of either 5 log10 CCID50 (full human dose ranging from 4.5 log10 to \n6.0 log10 CCID50), 6.5 log10 CCID50 (about 3 times the highest human dose) or 8 log10 CCID50 \n(about 100 times the highest human dose) of DENGVAXIA by intravenous injection on Day 6, 9 \nor 12 of gestation. At doses of 6.5 log10 CCID50 or 8 log10 CCID50 of DENGVAXIA, maternal \ntoxicity was observed which was associated with increased postimplantation loss and at doses of \n8 log10 CCID50 with reduced fetal body weight. The significance of this observation for humans \nis unknown, especially considering the different route of administration (the human route of \nadministration is subcutaneous) and dose levels which exceeded the intended human dose. There \nwere no vaccine related fetal malformations or other evidence of teratogenesis noted in this study. \n8.2 \nLactation  \nRisk Summary \nHuman data are not available to assess the impact of DENGVAXIA on milk production, its \npresence in breast milk, or its effects on the breastfed child. The developmental and health \nbenefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for \nDENGVAXIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from DENGVAXIA or \nfrom the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying condition is \nsusceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. A lactation study in which female mice were \nadministered a single dose of DENGVAXIA on day 14 of lactation did not show the presence of \nDENGVAXIA in breast milk. \nClinical Considerations \nDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk  \nVertical transmission of dengue virus, including potentially through breastmilk, has been reported. \nFetal/neonatal adverse reactions \nsanofi pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n323 – DENGVAXIA® \n \n \n13 \n \nVaccine viremia can occur 7 to 14 days after vaccination with a duration of <7 days. [See \nPharmacokinetics (12.3).] The potential for transmission of the vaccine virus from mother to \ninfant through breastmilk is unknown. \nAnimal Data \nA developmental toxicity study in which female mice were administered a single injection of 5 \nlog10 CCID50 (full human dose ranging from 4.5 log10 to 6.0 log10 CCID50), 6.5 log10 CCID50 or 8 \nlog10 CCID50 of DENGVAXIA by intravenous injection on Day 14 of lactation did not show the \npresence of DENGVAXIA in breast milk in mice when measured 24 hours after vaccine \nadministration. \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nDENGVAXIA is not approved for use in individuals younger than 6 years of age. Evidence from \nclinical studies strongly suggests that DENGVAXIA would be unsafe in individuals younger \nthan 6 years of age because of an increased risk of severe and hospitalized dengue regardless of \ndengue serostatus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use  \nSafety and effectiveness of DENGVAXIA in adults 65 years of age and older have not been \nestablished.  \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nDENGVAXIA (Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine, Live) is a sterile suspension for subcutaneous \ninjection. DENGVAXIA is supplied as a vial of lyophilized vaccine antigen, which must be \nreconstituted at the time of use with 0.6 mL from the accompanying vial of diluent (0.4% sodium \nchloride). After reconstitution, DENGVAXIA is a clear, colorless suspension (trace amounts of \nwhite to translucent proteinaceous particles may be present). [See Dosage and Administration \n(2.3).] \nAfter reconstitution, each 0.5 mL dose of DENGVAXIA contains 4.5 - 6.0 log10 CCID50 of each \nof the chimeric yellow fever dengue (CYD) virus serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each 0.5 mL dose is \nformulated to contain 2 mg sodium chloride and the following ingredients as stabilizers: 0.56 mg \nessential amino acids (including L-phenylalanine), 0.2 mg non-essential amino acids, 2.5 mg \nL-arginine hydrochloride, 18.75 mg sucrose, 13.75 mg D-trehalose dihydrate, 9.38 mg \nD-sorbitol, 0.18 mg trometamol, and 0.63 mg urea. \nEach of the four CYD viruses (CYD-1, CYD-2, CYD-3, and CYD-4) in DENGVAXIA was \nconstructed using recombinant DNA technology by replacing the sequences encoding the \npre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins in the yellow fever (YF) 17D204 vaccine virus \ngenome with those encoding for the homologous sequences of dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3, \nand 4, respectively. Each CYD virus is cultured separately in Vero cells (African Green Monkey \nkidney) under serum-free conditions, harvested from the supernatant of the Vero cells and \npurified by membrane chromatography and ultrafiltration. The purified and concentrated harvest \nof each CYD virus is then diluted in a stabilizer solution to produce the four monovalent drug \nsubstances. The final bulk product is a mixture of the four monovalent drug substances diluted in \nsanofi pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n323 – DENGVAXIA® \n \n \n14 \n \nthe stabilizer solution. The final bulk product is sterilized by filtration at 0.22 µm, filled into \nvials and freeze-dried. \nDENGVAXIA does not contain preservative. \nThe vial stoppers for the Lyophilized Vaccine Antigen and Diluent vials of DENGVAXIA are \nnot made with natural rubber latex. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 Mechanism of Action  \nFollowing administration, DENGVAXIA elicits dengue-specific immune responses against the \nfour dengue virus serotypes. The exact mechanism of protection has not been determined. \n12.3 Pharmacokinetics  \nViremia \nIn studies that evaluated the occurrence of vaccine viremia systematically at pre-specified \ntimepoints, vaccine viremia (measured by genomic amplification methods) was observed \nfollowing vaccination with DENGVAXIA in 5.6% of subjects, with 90% of these occurrences \ndocumented after the first injection. Vaccine viremia was observed 7 to 14 days after \nDENGVAXIA vaccination with a duration of <7 days. \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nDENGVAXIA has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of \nmale fertility. Exposure of female rabbits to DENGVAXIA prior to and during gestation did not \nimpair fertility. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.1).] \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \n14.1 Efficacy  \nThe efficacy of DENGVAXIA was evaluated in two randomized, observer-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled, multi-center studies. Study 1 (N=20,869) was conducted in individuals 9 through 16 \nyears of age in four Latin American countries and Puerto Rico; and Study 2 (N=10,275) was \nconducted in individuals 2 through 14 years of age in five Asia-Pacific countries. A subset of \nsubjects in each study (10% in Study 1; 20% in Study 2) was evaluated for antibodies  to dengue \nvirus at the time of enrollment and at later time points. Both studies enrolled subjects irrespective \nof evidence of previous dengue infection. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either \nDENGVAXIA or saline placebo and were monitored for symptomatic virologically confirmed \ndengue (VCD) starting at Day 0. Per protocol vaccine efficacy was assessed beginning 28 days \nafter the third vaccination for 12 months. VCD was defined as an acute febrile illness \n(temperature ≥38°C on at least 2 consecutive days) virologically confirmed by dengue RT-PCR \nsanofi pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n323 – DENGVAXIA® \n \n \n15 \n \nand/or dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) ELISA Antigen Test. For each study, in pre-\nspecified vaccine efficacy analyses including the full age range of subjects enrolled, the \npre-specified criterion for demonstrating efficacy of DENGVAXIA against VCD due to any \ndengue virus serotype and irrespective of previous dengue virus infection, was met (lower bound \nof 95% CI for vaccine efficacy >25%). These studies were not designed to demonstrate efficacy \nof DENGVAXIA against individual dengue serotypes.  \nGiven the identification of the increased risk for severe dengue following vaccination with \nDENGVAXIA and subsequent infection with dengue virus in persons not previously infected \nwith dengue virus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], Table 4 presents analyses of vaccine efficacy \nagainst VCD due to any dengue virus serotype, limited to subjects who had baseline sera \nevaluated and who were dengue seropositive at baseline. These analyses include subjects 9 \nthrough 16 years of age from Study 1 and subjects 6 through 14 years of age from Study 2. \nTable  4: Efficacy of DENGVAXIA against Symptomatic VCD in Subjects Seropositive for \nDengue at Baseline from 28 Days Post Dose 3 for a Period of 12 Months – Study 1 (Ages 9 \nthrough 16 Years) and Study 2 (Ages 6 through 14 Years) – mFASE* – Subjects Included \nin the Immunogenicity Subset  \n \nDENGVAXIA \ngroup \nCases (Subjects) \nPlacebo group \nCases (Subjects) \nVE % (95% CI)† \nStudy 1  \n(Subjects 9 through 16 years of \nage) \n7 (1034) \n17 (492) \n80.6 (50.7;93.2) \nStudy 2  \n(Subjects 6 through 14 years of \nage) \n6 (649) \n15 (337) \n79.5 (44.2;93.5) \n*  mFASE (Modified Full Analysis Set): Set of the subjects who received 3 injections as per randomization including those with \nprotocol deviations. \n† VE is calculated as 1- ratio of density incidence of dengue between DENGVAXIA and Placebo groups. \n14.2 Immunogenicity of Concomitantly Administered Vaccines  \nIn a randomized, multicenter, open-label study (NCT02992418), 688 subjects aged from 9 \nthrough 60 years in the Philippines were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into two groups. In group 1, \nparticipants received Adacel concomitantly with the first dose of DENGVAXIA. In group 2, \nparticipants received Adacel followed by the first dose of DENGVAXIA one month later. A \nsubgroup analysis was conducted including subjects 9 through 16 years of age who were dengue \nimmune at baseline (Group 1 N=137, Group 2 N=133). There was no evidence of interference in \nthe immune responses to Adacel when concomitantly administered with a first dose of \nDENGVAXIA as assessed by geometric mean concentrations of antibodies to the pertussis \nantigens contained in the vaccine and seroprotection rates for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids 28 \ndays after vaccine administration.  No information is available on the concommitant \nadministration of Adacel and DENGVAXIA after the three-dose vaccination schedule.  \nsanofi pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n323 – DENGVAXIA® \n \n \n16 \n \nImmune responses following the third dose of DENGVAXIA could not be assessed due to early \ntermination of the study.  \n16 \nHOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING  \n16.1 How Supplied  \nAn outer package of 1 dose (NDC 49281-605-01) contains 1 single dose vial of Lyophilized \nVaccine Antigen (NDC 49281-606-58) and 1 single dose vial of Saline Diluent \n(NDC 49281-549-58). \nThe vial stoppers for the Lyophilized Vaccine Antigen vials and the Saline Diluent vials of \nDENGVAXIA are not made with natural rubber latex. \n16.2 Storage and Handling  \nStore Lyophilized Vaccine Antigen and Saline Diluent in a refrigerator at 2C to 8C (36F to \n46F).

Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral is approved for use in military \npopulations 17 through 50 years of age. \n2 \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \nA single vaccine dose is administered orally as two tablets: one tablet of Adenovirus Type 4 and \none tablet of Adenovirus Type 7. (2) \nThe tablets should be swallowed whole, without chewing, to avoid releasing the virus in the \nupper respiratory tract [See Mechanism of Action (12.1)]. \nPostpone administration to individuals with vomiting and/or diarrhea because the effectiveness \nof the vaccine depends upon the multiplication of orally administered live adenovirus within the \nintestinal tract [See Mechanism of Action (12.1)]. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \nA single vaccine dose consists of two tablets: one tablet of Adenovirus Type 4 and one tablet of \nAdenovirus Type 7. \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \n4.1 \nPregnancy \nAdenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral should not be administered to pregnant \nfemales [See Pregnancy (8.1)]. It is not known whether Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, \nLive, Oral can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect \nreproduction capacity. Naturally occurring infection with adenoviruses has been associated with \nfetal harm. Pregnancy should be avoided for 6 weeks following receipt of vaccine. \n4.2 \nSevere Allergic Reaction \nSevere allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 \nVaccine, Live, Oral is a Contraindication [See Description (11)]. \n4.3 \nInability to Swallow \nAdenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral should not be administered to individuals \nincapable of swallowing each entire tablet, whole, without chewing. Chewing a tablet could \n \n3 \n \nexpose the upper respiratory tract to live adenovirus leading to disease [See Mechanism of Action \n(12.1)]. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n5.1 \nAltered Immunocompetence \nThe safety and effectiveness of Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral in \nimmunocompromised individuals has not been evaluated.  \n5.2 \nShedding and Transmission \nAdenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral contains live viruses that are shed in the \nstool and can cause disease if transmitted.  \nPeople who come in close contact with those who were vaccinated, including other vaccinees, \nmay be exposed to the virus present in the stool and may develop disease [See \nPharmacodynamics (12.2)]. \nPersons vaccinated with Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral should exercise \ncaution when in close contact with children less than 7 years of age and immunocompromised \nindividuals such as those with HIV infection and cancer, or those receiving immunosuppressive \ntherapy during the 28 day period of viral shedding following the vaccination [See Use in Specific \nPopulations (8.3) and Pharmacodynamics (12.2)]. \nVaccinees should exercise caution when in close contact with pregnant women during the 28 day \nperiod of shedding because fetal harm may result if pregnant women are exposed to adenovirus \n[See Pregnancy (8.1) and Pharmacodynamics (12.2)]. \n5.3 \nPlanning for Pregnancy \nUse effective contraception for 6 weeks after vaccination to avoid pregnancy  [See Pregnancy \n(8.1)]. \n5.4 \nHuman Serum Albumin \nAdenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral contains albumin, a derivative of human \nblood. It is present at concentrations of <0.3 mg/tablet. Based on effective donor screening, and \nproduct manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral \ndiseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) also is \nconsidered extremely remote. No cases of transmissions of viral diseases or CJD have ever been \nidentified for human albumin. \n \n4 \n \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience \nBecause clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical studies of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to the rates in the \nclinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nMulticenter Safety and Efficacy Trial \nSafety of Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral was evaluated in a multicenter, \ndouble-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 3031 subjects who received \nvaccine and 1009 subjects who received placebo (lactose tablets). The study was conducted in \nhealthy male (63%) and female (37%) active duty US Army and Navy military recruits during \ntheir basic training. The population had a mean age of 21 years, with an age range of 17 to 42 \nyears. Race was 62% Caucasian, 18% African-American, 11% Hispanic, 3% Asian and 6% \nother. Subjects in both groups were administered other vaccines concomitantly with Adenovirus \nType 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral. The specific vaccines that each subject received varied \nand were dependent on their immunization history. The vaccines that were co-administered \nincluded Hepatitis A Vaccine, Inactivated (Merck & Co., Inc.), Hepatitis A Inactivated and \nHepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), Hepatitis B Vaccine \n(Recombinant) (Merck & Co., Inc.), Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) \nVaccine, Recombinant (Merck & Co., Inc.), Influenza Vaccine, Live, Intranasal (MedImmune, \nLLC), Influenza Virus Vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, Inc.), Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus \nVaccine Live (Merck & Co., Inc.), Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide, \nDiphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, Inc.), Meningococcal Polysaccharide \nVaccine (Groups A, C, Y and W-135 Combined) (Sanofi Pasteur, Inc.), Poliovirus Vaccine \nInactivated (Sanofi Pasteur, SA), Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular \nPertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed (Sanofi  \nPasteur, Ltd.), Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine, \nAdsorbed (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, \nSA), Varicella Virus Vaccine Live (Merck & Co., Inc.), Yellow Fever Vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, \nInc.). \nSerious Adverse Events \nNo deaths were reported during the multicenter safety and efficacy trial. \nSerious adverse events in vaccine recipients included hematuria, gastroenteritis, febrile \ngastroenteritis, gastritis, pneumonia, and hematochezia.  \nFifty-seven serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported during the six month study period with \n39 reported between 0 and 56 days following treatment and 18 reported during the 56 to 180 day \nfollow-up period. Thirty-five subjects (1.2%) who received vaccine (25 between 0 and 56 days \nfrom the date of vaccination, 10 during the 56 to 180 day follow-up period) and 12 subjects \n(1.2%) who received placebo (9 between 0 and 56 days from the date of treatment, 3 during the \n56 to 180 day follow-up period) experienced at least one SAE. The SAEs occurring between Day \n0 and Day 56 post-vaccination in the vaccine group, possibly associated with the receipt of the \nvaccine product as determined by the investigator, were as follows: one subject with hematuria \n \n5 \n \nand gastroenteritis (at 9 days post vaccination), one subject with febrile gastroenteritis (at 4 days \npost vaccination, one subject with gastritis (at 23 days post vaccination), and one subject with \npneumonia (at 23 days post vaccination); one SAE (hematochezia) in the vaccine group occurred \nduring the 56 to 180 day follow-up period and was determined to be possibly related to the \nvaccine product. A placebo recipient developed febrile acute respiratory disease where \nadenovirus Type 4 vaccine strain was detected from posterior pharyngeal and tonsillar swabbing \nand characterized by serotyping and polymerase chain reaction analysis [See Warnings and \nPrecautions: Shedding and Transmission (5.2)]. \nOverall, the percentage of subjects who experienced at least one adverse event during the 56 day \nstudy period was 91.2% in the Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral group \ncompared to 93.9% in the placebo group. No subject in either treatment arm discontinued the \nstudy due to an adverse event. Adverse reactions were captured on a 2-Week Daily Diary (for a \nminimum of the first 780 subjects) or a 1-Week Daily Diary (for all remaining subjects) and \nwere also reported at each study visit up to Day 56 after vaccination. Any reported AEs for Days \n0-14 for the safety cohort and for Days 0-7 for the remaining subjects were defined as \"solicited\" \nbecause they were almost exclusively recorded directly by the subject from a pre-defined diary \nchecklist. Although pyrexia was defined as “solicited,” it was not on the pre-defined diary \nchecklist. Any AEs reported spontaneously as part of the regular study visit or during a \nspontaneous visit to the clinic, for Days 15-56 for the safety cohort and Days 8-56 for the \nremaining subjects were designated as \"non-solicited.\"  \nSolicited Adverse Reactions \nThe following solicited adverse reactions were collected through daily diaries: stuffy nose, \ncough, sore throat, stomach pain, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and joint pain (within 14 days post \nenrollment for subjects in the initial safety cohort (n=878) and within 7 days post enrollment all \nsubjects (n= 4040) for the rest of safety population). Those solicited adverse reactions reported \nby ≥ 5 % of subjects in either the vaccine or placebo treatment groups are presented in Table 1. \nTable 1: \nSolicited Adverse Reactions, Days 0-7 for All Subjects and Days 8-14 for the \nSafety Cohort, Reported by ≥ 5% of Subjects in the Multicenter Safety and \nEfficacy Trial \nAdverse  \nReaction* \nAdenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 \nVaccine, Live, Oral \nPlacebo \n \n0-7 Days \nN = 3031 \n8-14 Days \nN = 660 \n0-7 Days \nN = 1009 \n8-14 Days \nN = 218 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nn \n% \nn \n% \nn \n% \nn \n% \nHeadache \n894 \n29.5 \n38 \n6.5 \n310 \n30.7 \n11 \n5.6 \nNasal Congestion (Stuffy \nNose) \n463 \n15.3 \n49 \n8.4 \n141 \n14.0 \n12 \n6.2 \nPharyngolaryngeal Pain \n(Sore Throat) \n391 \n12.9 \n72 \n12.3 \n124 \n12.3 \n24 \n12.3 \nCough \n375 \n12.4 \n59 \n10.1 \n130 \n12.9 \n14 \n7.2 \n \n6 \n \nAdverse  \nReaction* \nAdenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 \nVaccine, Live, Oral \nPlacebo \n \n0-7 Days \nN = 3031 \n8-14 Days \nN = 660 \n0-7 Days \nN = 1009 \n8-14 Days \nN = 218 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nn \n% \nn \n% \nn \n% \nn \n% \nNausea \n412 \n13.6 \n29 \n5.0 \n137 \n13.6 \n11 \n5.6 \nDiarrhea \n310 \n10.2 \n18 \n3.1 \n84 \n8.3 \n10 \n5.1 \n*MedDRA Preferred Term \n \nPyrexia (temp ≥ 100.5°F) within 7 days, was reported to occur in 1.4% (42/3030) of vaccine \nrecipients and 0.5% (5/961) of placebo recipients who were not diagnosed with ARD.

Two \nSAEs occurred among the vaccine recipients: one case of pneumonia reported on Day 33 of the \nfollow-up period, and a report of appendicitis occurring on Day 118 of follow-up period. Three \nSAEs were reported among placebo recipients: one case of pneumonia on Day 10 and one case \nof upper respiratory infection reported on Day 14, and a right thigh abscess reported at Day 91. \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Adenovirus \nType 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a \npopulation of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or \nestablish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. \nImmune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) \nNervous System Disorders: Guillain-Barré syndrome \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS \n7.1 \nConcomitant Vaccine Administration \nIn clinical studies Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral was administered \nconcurrently with other vaccines [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Data were not available to \nassess whether Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral interferes with the immune \nresponse to the other vaccines.  \n7.2 \nImmunosuppressive Therapies \nThere are no data regarding the use of Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral \nconcomitantly with immunosuppressive therapies, e.g., irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating \nagents, cytotoxic drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses) [See \nWarnings and Precautions: Altered Immunocompetence (5.1)]. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n8.1 \nPregnancy \nRisk Summary \nDo not administer Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral to pregnant females [See \nContraindications (4.1)]. It is not known whether Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, \n \n8 \n \nOral can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Naturally occurring infection \nwith adenoviruses has been associated with fetal harm.  \nPregnancy should be avoided for 6 weeks following receipt of vaccine. \nIn the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and \nmiscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.  \nClinical Considerations \nLabor and Delivery \nThere is no information regarding the effect of Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, \nOral on labor and delivery. Fecal shedding during delivery may result in vaccine virus \ntransmission to the newborn infant. \nData \nHuman Data \nFive pregnancies were reported among women enrolled in the multicenter safety and efficacy \ntrial of Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral. Four of the subjects (3 vaccine \nrecipients and 1 placebo recipient) were estimated to have conceived 2 to 13 days prior to \nvaccination. One subject (vaccine recipient) conceived approximately 21 weeks after \nvaccination. The deliveries to all five of the subjects were of healthy infants at estimated \ngestational ages between 36 and 40 weeks. \n8.2 \nLactation \nRisk Summary \nThere are no data on the presence of Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral in \nhuman milk, effects on milk production, or on the breastfed infant.  \nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the \nmother’s clinical need for Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral and any potential \nadverse effects on the breastfed infant from Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral \nor from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal \ncondition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. \n8.3 \nFemales and Males of Reproductive Potential \nPregnancy Testing \nAdenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral is contraindicated for use in pregnant women \n[See Pregnancy (4.1)]. Females of reproductive potential should have a pregnancy test prior to \ntreatment with Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral. \nContraception \nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with \nAdenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral and for 6 weeks following receipt of vaccine. \n \n9 \n \n8.4 \nPediatric Use \nThe safety and effectiveness of Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral has not been \nevaluated in the age groups from birth through age 16. \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use \nClinical studies of Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral did not include subjects \naged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. There are \nno data to support use of this vaccine in geriatric (person ≥ 65 years) populations. \n11 \nDESCRIPTION \nAdenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral contains viable, selected strains of human \nadenovirus Type 4 and human adenovirus Type 7 prepared in human-diploid fibroblast cell \ncultures (strain WI-38). The virus strains have not been attenuated. The cells are grown and the \nvirus growth maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, fetal bovine serum, and \nsodium bicarbonate. The virus is harvested, freed of particulate cellular material by filtration, \nformulated and dried by lyophilization. The dried virus material includes monosodium \nglutamate, sucrose, D-mannose, D-fructose, dextrose, human serum albumin, potassium \nphosphate, and plasdone C. \nThe final vaccine is composed of two tablets (one tablet of Adenovirus Type 4 and one tablet of \nAdenovirus Type 7) designed to pass intact through the stomach and release the live virus in the \nintestine. Each enteric-coated tablet contains an inner core tablet containing anhydrous lactose, \nmicrocrystalline cellulose, polacrilin potassium, magnesium stearate, and live adenovirus, either \nType 4 or Type 7, at a potency of no fewer than 32,000 tissue-culture infective doses (4.5 log10 \nTCID50) per tablet. The outer tablet layer contains microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium \nstearate, and anhydrous lactose, with an enteric coating consisting of cellulose acetate phthalate, \nalcohol, acetone, and castor oil. The Type 7 tablet also contains FD&C Yellow #6 aluminum \nlake dye. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action \nAdenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral is a live oral vaccine that replicates in the \nintestinal tract and induces immunity in persons with low or no pre-existing neutralizing \nantibodies. \n12.2 \nPharmacodynamics \nVaccine Virus Shedding \nFecal shedding of Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral strain viruses was \nevaluated in a safety and immunogenicity study of 58 subjects (30 vaccine recipients and 28 \nplacebo recipients) [See Clinical Studies (14)]. Stool or rectal swabs and throat swabs were \ncollected on Day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 56. Vaccine virus strains were shed in the stool as early as \n \n10 \n \nday 7 following vaccination. Eight of 30 vaccine recipients (27%) tested positive at least once for \nAdenovirus Type 4 fecal shedding; 18 of 30 vaccine recipients (60%) tested positive for \nAdenovirus Type 7 fecal shedding. No adenovirus shedding was detectable in any subject by 28 \ndays following vaccination. Vaccine strain virus was not detected in the throat of any subject. \n13 \nNONCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nAdenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or \nmutagenic potential, or for impairment of male fertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES \n14.1 \nMulticenter Safety and Efficacy Trial \nA multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in US military recruits \nevaluated the safety and efficacy of Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral to \nprevent wild Type 4 adenovirus-associated febrile acute respiratory disease (ARD) and to induce \nneutralizing antibody to Type 7 adenovirus. A seroconversion endpoint rather than prevention of \nclinical disease was used to assess efficacy of the Type 7 adenovirus vaccine component of this \nproduct as the incidence of febrile ARD due to Type 7 adenovirus was not anticipated to be high \nenough to permit a meaningful statistical assessment of the clinical effect of this vaccine \ncomponent. Subjects were randomized to either the vaccine group or the placebo group in a 3:1 \nratio. 4041 subjects were randomized, and 4040 subjects were analyzed. Females and males aged \n17 or older and in good physical health were included in the study. No subjects were \nimmunosuppressed or being treated with systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

VAXELIS is approved for use as a 3-dose series in children 6 weeks \nthrough 4 years of age (prior to the 5th birthday). \n2 \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  \nFor intramuscular use only. \n2.1 \nVaccination Schedule  \nVAXELIS is to be administered as a 3-dose series at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The first dose may \nbe given as early as 6 weeks of age. Three doses of VAXELIS constitute a primary immunization \ncourse against diphtheria, tetanus, H. influenzae type b invasive disease and poliomyelitis. \nVAXELIS may be used to complete the hepatitis B immunization series. \nA 3-dose series of VAXELIS does not constitute a primary immunization series against pertussis; \nan additional dose of pertussis-containing vaccine is needed to complete the primary series. [See \nPertussis Vaccination Following VAXELIS.] \nPertussis Vaccination following VAXELIS \nVAXELIS, Pentacel® [(Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, \nInactivated Poliovirus and Haemophilus b Conjugate (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate) Vaccine): \nDTaP-IPV/Hib], Quadracel® [(Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed \nand Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine): DTaP-IPV] and DAPTACEL® [(Diphtheria and Tetanus \nToxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed): DTaP] contain the same pertussis antigens \nmanufactured by the same process. Children who have received a 3-dose series of VAXELIS \nshould complete the primary and pertussis vaccination series with Pentacel, Quadracel or \nDAPTACEL according to the respective prescribing information in the approved package inserts. \n[See ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) AND CLINICAL STUDIES (14).] \nAdministration of VAXELIS following previous doses of other DTaP-containing Vaccines \nVAXELIS may be used to complete the first 3 doses of the 5-dose DTaP series in infants and \nchildren who have received 1 or 2 doses of Pentacel or DAPTACEL and are also scheduled to \nreceive the other antigens in VAXELIS. Data are not available on the safety and immunogenicity \nof such mixed sequences. \nData are not available on the safety and effectiveness of using VAXELIS following 1 or 2 doses \nof a DTaP vaccine from a different manufacturer.  \nAdministration of VAXELIS following previous doses of any Hepatitis B Vaccine \nA 3-dose series of VAXELIS may be administered to infants born to HBsAg-negative mothers, \nand who have received a dose of any hepatitis B vaccine, prior to or at 1 month of age. \n[See ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) AND CLINICAL STUDIES (14).] \n \n \n3 \n \nVAXELIS may be used to complete the hepatitis B vaccination series following 1 or 2 doses of \nother hepatitis B vaccines, in infants and children born of HBsAg-negative mothers and who are \nalso scheduled to receive the other antigens in VAXELIS. However, data are not available on the \nsafety and effectiveness of VAXELIS in such infants and children. \nAdministration of VAXELIS following previous doses of Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) \nVAXELIS may be administered to infants and children who have received 1 or 2 doses of IPV \nand are also scheduled to receive the other antigens in VAXELIS. However, data are not available \non the safety and effectiveness of VAXELIS in such infants and children. \nAdministration of VAXELIS following previous doses of Haemophilus b Conjugate \nVaccines \nVAXELIS may be administered to infants and children who have received 1 or 2 doses of \nH. influenzae type b Conjugate Vaccine and are also scheduled to receive the other antigens in \nVAXELIS. However, data are not available on the safety and effectiveness of VAXELIS in such \ninfants and children.  \n2.2 \nAdministration  \nJust before use, shake the vial or syringe until a uniform, white, cloudy suspension results.  \nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration \nprior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exist, \nthe product should not be administered.  \nAdminister a single 0.5 mL dose of VAXELIS intramuscularly.  \nIn infants younger than 1 year, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is the preferred site of \ninjection. The vaccine should not be injected into the gluteal area.  \nVAXELIS should not be combined through reconstitution or mixed with any other vaccine. \nDiscard unused portion. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nVAXELIS is a suspension for injection available in 0.5 mL single-dose vials and prefilled \nsyringes. [See HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING (16).] \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity  \nDo not administer VAXELIS to anyone with a history of a severe allergic reaction \n(e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of VAXELIS, any ingredient of VAXELIS, or any other \ndiphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis-containing vaccine, inactivated poliovirus vaccine, \nhepatitis B vaccine, or H. influenzae type b vaccine [See DESCRIPTION (11).] \n4.2 \nEncephalopathy  \nDo not administer VAXELIS to anyone with a history of encephalopathy (e.g., coma, decreased \nlevel of consciousness, prolonged seizures) within 7 days of a previous dose of a \npertussis-containing vaccine, that is not attributable to another identifiable cause.  \n \n \n4 \n \n4.3 \nProgressive Neurologic Disorder  \nDo not administer VAXELIS to anyone with a history of progressive neurologic disorder, \nincluding infantile spasms, uncontrolled epilepsy, or progressive encephalopathy until a treatment \nregimen has been established and the condition has stabilized.  \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nManagement of Acute Allergic Reactions  \nEpinephrine hydrochloride solution (1:1,000) and other appropriate agents and equipment must be \navailable for immediate use in case an anaphylactic or acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs.  \n5.2 \nAdverse Reactions Following Prior Pertussis Vaccination  \nIf any of the following events occur after administration of a pertussis vaccine, the decision to \nadminister VAXELIS should be based on careful consideration of potential benefits and possible \nrisks. \n• Temperature of 40.5°C (105°F) within 48 hours, not attributable to another identifiable \ncause. \n• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode [HHE]) within 48 hours. \n• Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours within 48 hours. \n• Seizures with or without fever within 3 days. \n5.3 \nGuillain-Barré Syndrome and Brachial Neuritis  \nA review by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found evidence for a causal relation between tetanus \ntoxoid and both brachial neuritis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. If Guillain-Barré syndrome \noccurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the risk for \nGuillain-Barré syndrome may be increased following VAXELIS. (1) \n5.4 \nAltered Immunocompetence  \nIf VAXELIS is administered to immunocompromised persons, including persons receiving \nimmunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained.  \n5.5 \nApnea in Premature Infants  \nApnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. \nThe decision about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including VAXELIS, to an \ninfant born prematurely should be based on consideration of the infant’s medical status and the \npotential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. \n5.6 \nLimitations of Vaccine Effectiveness  \nVaccination with VAXELIS may not protect all individuals. \n5.7 \nInterference with Laboratory Tests  \nUrine antigen detection may not have definitive diagnostic value in suspected H. influenzae type b \ndisease following vaccination with VAXELIS. [See DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1).]  \n \n \n5 \n \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \nRates of adverse reactions varied by number of doses of VAXELIS received. The solicited \nadverse reactions 0-5 days following any dose were irritability (≥55%), crying (≥45%), injection \nsite pain (≥44%), somnolence (≥40%), injection site erythema (≥25%), decreased appetite \n(≥23%), fever ≥38.0°C (≥19%), injection site swelling (≥18%), and vomiting (≥9%). \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in \nthe clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another \nvaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from \nclinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be \nrelated to vaccine use and for approximating rates of those events. \nThe safety of VAXELIS was evaluated in 6 clinical studies, in which a total of 5,251 infants 43 to \n99 days of age at enrollment received at least 1 dose of VAXELIS. Two of these (study 005 and \n006) were controlled clinical studies conducted in the US, in which a total of 3,380 infants 46 to \n89 days of age at enrollment received at least 1 dose of VAXELIS. The vaccination schedules of \nVAXELIS, Control vaccines, and concomitantly administered vaccines used in these studies are \nprovided in Table 1. At 15 months of age, participants in Study 005 received a dose of \nDAPTACEL and a H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine, whereas participants in Study 006 \nreceived a dose of Pentacel. In a non-US study, 294 children received a dose of VAXELIS at 15 \nmonths of age. \nAcross the 2 studies conducted in the US, among all randomized participants (3,392 in the \nVAXELIS group and 889 in the Control group), 52.6% were male and 47.4% were female. The \nrace distribution was as follows: 71.7% were White, 11.0% were Black, 4.5% were American \nIndian or Alaska Native, 3.5% were Asian, and 9.3% were of other racial groups.

Causes of death among infants who received VAXELIS were sepsis, 2 cases \nof Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, asphyxia, unknown cause, and hydrocephalus (occurring 2, \n10 and 49, 42, 44 days, and 11 months post-vaccination, respectively). Across all 6 clinical \nstudies, there were no deaths assessed as related to VAXELIS.  \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience  \nThe following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing use of VAXELIS or \nother vaccines containing the antigens of VAXELIS. These adverse events are included based on \na suspected causal connection to VAXELIS or the components of DAPTACEL® (Diphtheria and \nTetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed), IPOL® (Poliovirus Vaccine \nInactivated), COMVAX® [Haemophilus b Conjugate (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate) and \nHepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine]. (COMVAX is no longer licensed in the US.) \nBecause these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not \npossible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccination.  \n• Immune System Disorders \nHypersensitivity (such as rash, urticaria, dyspnea, erythema multiforme), anaphylactic \nreaction (such as urticaria, angioedema, edema, face edema, shock).  \n• General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \nExtensive swelling of injected limb (including swelling that involves adjacent joints).  \n• Nervous System \nSeizure, febrile seizure, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (HHE). \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 \nInterference with Laboratory Tests  \nSensitive tests (e.g., Latex Agglutination kits) have detected vaccine-derived polyribosylribitol \nphosphate (PRP) in the urine of vaccinees for at least 30 days following vaccination with \nPedvaxHIB [Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate)]. (2) \nTherefore, urine antigen detection may not have definite diagnostic value in suspected \nH. influenzae type b disease following vaccination with VAXELIS. [See WARNINGS AND \nPRECAUTIONS (5.7).] \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.1 \nPregnancy  \nVAXELIS is not approved for use in individuals 5 years of age and older. No human or animal \ndata are available to assess vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. \n8.2 \nLactation  \nVAXELIS is not approved for use in individuals 5 years of age and older. No human or animal \ndata are available to assess the impact of VAXELIS on milk production, its presence in breast \nmilk, or its effects on the breastfed infant.  \n \n \n10 \n \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nThe safety of VAXELIS has been established in the age group 6 weeks through 15 months, and \nthe effectiveness of VAXELIS was established in the age group 6 weeks through 6 months on \nthe basis of clinical studies. [See ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) AND CLINICAL STUDIES (14).]  \nThe safety and effectiveness of VAXELIS in older children through 4 years of age are supported \nby evidence in younger children. The safety and effectiveness of VAXELIS in infants less than 6 \nweeks of age and in children and adolescents 5 through 17 years of age have not been \nestablished.  \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nVAXELIS (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis, Inactivated Poliovirus, \nHaemophilus b Conjugate and Hepatitis B Vaccine) is a sterile suspension for intramuscular \ninjection.  \nEach 0.5 mL dose is formulated to contain 15 Lf diphtheria toxoid, 5 Lf tetanus toxoid, acellular \npertussis antigens [20 mcg detoxified pertussis toxin (PT), 20 mcg filamentous hemagglutinin \n(FHA), 3 mcg pertactin (PRN), 5 mcg fimbriae types 2 and 3 (FIM)], inactivated polioviruses \n[29 D-antigen units (DU) Type 1 (Mahoney), 7 DU Type 2 (MEF-1), 26 DU Type 3 (Saukett)], \n3 mcg polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) of H. influenzae type b covalently bound to 50 mcg of \nthe outer membrane protein complex (OMPC) of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B, and \n10 mcg hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Each 0.5 mL dose contains 319 mcg aluminum \nfrom aluminum salts used as adjuvants. \nOther ingredients per 0.5 mL dose include <0.0056% polysorbate 80 and the following residuals \nfrom the manufacturing process: ≤14 mcg formaldehyde, ≤50 ng glutaraldehyde, ≤50 ng bovine \nserum albumin, <5 ng of neomycin, <200 ng streptomycin sulfate, <25 ng polymyxin B sulfate, \n≤0.125 μg ammonium thiocyanate and ≤0.1 mcg yeast protein (maximum 1% relative to HBsAg \nprotein). \nCorynebacterium diphtheriae is grown in modified Mueller’s growth medium. (3) After \npurification by ammonium sulfate fractionation, the diphtheria toxin is detoxified with \nformaldehyde and diafiltered. \nClostridium tetani is grown in modified Mueller-Miller casamino acid medium without beef \nheart infusion. (4) Tetanus toxin is detoxified with formaldehyde and purified by ammonium \nsulfate fractionation and diafiltration. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are individually adsorbed \nonto aluminum phosphate. \nThe acellular pertussis vaccine antigens are produced from Bordetella pertussis cultures grown \nin Stainer-Scholte medium (5) modified by the addition of casamino acids and dimethyl-beta-\ncyclodextrin. PT, FHA and PRN are isolated separately from the supernatant culture medium. \nFIM are extracted and copurified from the bacterial cells. The pertussis antigens are purified by \nsequential filtration, salt-precipitation, ultrafiltration and chromatography. PT is detoxified with \nglutaraldehyde. FHA is treated with formaldehyde and the residual aldehydes are removed by \nultrafiltration. The individual antigens are adsorbed separately onto aluminum phosphate. \nThe Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 polioviruses are individually grown in Vero cells. The viral \nharvests are concentrated and purified, then inactivated with formaldehyde to produce \n \n \n11 \n \nmonovalent suspensions of each serotype. Specified quantities of monovalent suspensions of \neach serotype are mixed to produce the trivalent poliovirus concentrate. \nThe HBsAg antigen is harvested and purified from fermentation cultures of a recombinant strain \nof the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing the gene for the adw subtype of HBsAg. The \nrecombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae is grown in a fermentation medium which consists of an \nextract of yeast, soy peptone, dextrose, amino acids, and mineral salts. The HBsAg protein is \nreleased from the yeast cells by cell disruption and purified by a series of physical and chemical \nmethods which includes ion and hydrophobic chromatography, and diafiltration. The purified \nprotein is treated in phosphate buffer with formaldehyde and then co-precipitated with alum \n(potassium aluminum sulfate) to form bulk vaccine adjuvanted with amorphous aluminum \nhydroxyphosphate sulfate. \nThe purified PRP of H. influenzae type b (Haemophilus b, Ross strain) is conjugated to an \nOMPC of the B11 strain of N. meningitidis serogroup B. H. influenzae type b is grown in a \nfermentation medium which includes an extract of yeast, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, \nhemin chloride, soy peptone, dextrose, and mineral salts. The PRP is purified from the culture \nbroth by purification procedures which include ethanol fractionation, enzyme digestion, phenol \nextraction and diafiltration. N. meningitidis serogroup B is grown in a fermentation medium \nwhich includes an extract of yeast, amino acids and mineral salts. The OMPC is purified by \ndetergent extraction, ultracentrifugation, diafiltration and sterile filtration. PRP is conjugated to \nOMPC by chemical coupling and the PRP-OMPC is then adsorbed onto an amorphous \naluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate adjuvant. \nThe adsorbed diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis antigens are combined with aluminum \nphosphate (as adjuvant) and water for injection into an intermediate concentrate. The individual \nHBsAg and PRP-OMPC adjuvanted bulks are added followed by the trivalent poliovirus \nconcentrate, to produce VAXELIS. \nBoth diphtheria and tetanus toxoids induce at least 2 neutralizing units per mL of serum in the \nguinea pig potency test. The potency of the acellular pertussis antigens is evaluated by the \nantibody response of immunized mice to detoxified PT, FHA, PRN and FIM as measured by \nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The immunogenicity of the inactivated \npolioviruses is evaluated by the antibody response in rats measured by virus neutralization. The \npotency of the HBsAg component is measured relative to a standard by an in vitro immunoassay. \nThe potency of the PRP-OMPC component is measured by quantitating the polysaccharide \nconcentration using an HPLC method. \nVAXELIS does not contain a preservative. The vial stopper, syringe plunger stopper, and syringe \ntip cap are not made with natural rubber latex. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 Mechanism of Action  \nDiphtheria  \nDiphtheria is an acute toxin-mediated disease caused by toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae. \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to diphtheria \ntoxin. A serum diphtheria antitoxin level of 0.01 IU/mL is the lowest level giving some degree of \n \n \n12 \n \nprotection. Antitoxin levels of ≥0.1 IU/mL are generally regarded as protective. (6) Levels of \n1.0 IU/mL have been associated with long-term protection. (7) \nTetanus \nTetanus is an acute disease caused by an extremely potent neurotoxin produced by C. tetani. \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to tetanus toxin. \nA serum tetanus antitoxin level of ≥0.01 IU/mL, measured by neutralization assay is considered \nthe minimum protective level. (6) (8) A tetanus antitoxoid level ≥0.1 IU/mL as measured by the \nELISA used in clinical studies of VAXELIS is considered protective. \nPertussis \nPertussis (whooping cough) is a respiratory disease caused by B. pertussis. This Gram-negative \ncoccobacillus produces a variety of biologically active components, though their role in either \nthe pathogenesis of, or immunity to, pertussis has not been clearly defined. \nPoliomyelitis \nPolioviruses, of which there are 3 serotypes (Types 1, 2, and 3), are enteroviruses. The presence \nof poliovirus type-specific neutralizing antibodies has been correlated with protection against \npoliomyelitis. (9) \nHepatitis B \nHepatitis B virus is one of several hepatitis viruses that cause systemic infection, with major \npathology in the liver. Antibody concentrations of ≥10 mIU/mL against HBsAg correlate with \nprotection against hepatitis B virus infection. \nHaemophilus influenzae type b Invasive Disease \nH. influenzae type b can cause invasive disease such as meningitis and sepsis. Anti-PRP antibody \nhas been shown to correlate with protection against invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b.  \nBased on data from passive antibody studies (10) and an efficacy study with H. influenzae type b \npolysaccharide vaccine in Finland, (11) a post-vaccination anti-PRP level of ≥0.15 mcg/mL is \nconsidered a minimal protective level. Data from an efficacy study with H. influenzae type b \npolysaccharide vaccine in Finland indicate that an anti-PRP level of ≥1.0 mcg/mL 3 weeks after \nvaccination predicts protection through a subsequent 1-year period. (11) (12) These levels have \nbeen used to evaluate the effectiveness of H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines, including the \nPRP-OMPC component of VAXELIS. \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nVAXELIS has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of \nfertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \n14.1 Effectiveness of VAXELIS  \nThe effectiveness of VAXELIS is based on the immunogenicity of the individual antigens \ncompared to US licensed vaccines. Serological correlates of protection exist for diphtheria, \n \n \n13 \n \ntetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, and invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b. The \neffectiveness against pertussis is based upon the pertussis immune responses following 3 doses \nof VAXELIS compared to 3 doses of Pentacel, as well as the pertussis immune responses \nfollowing a subsequent dose of DAPTACEL in the same 2 groups of children. VAXELIS, \nPentacel and DAPTACEL contain the same pertussis antigens, manufactured by the same \nprocesses.  \n14.2 Immunogenicity  \nIn the US Study 005 (Table 1), infants were randomized to receive 3 doses of VAXELIS at 2, 4, \nand 6 months of age and DAPTACEL and PedvaxHIB at 15 months of age, or Control group \nvaccines (3 doses of Pentacel vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age + RECOMBIVAX HB at 2 \nand 6 months of age and DAPTACEL and ActHIB at 15 months of age). All subjects received \nconcomitant vaccines: RotaTeq at 2, 4 and 6 months and Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, 6, and 15 months of \nage. [See ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1).] All infants had received a dose of hepatitis B vaccine \nprior to study initiation, prior to or at one month of age. Among all randomized participants, \n53.0% were male and 47.0% were female. Most (79.2%) participants were White, 14.1% were \nBlack and 5.2% were multi-racial. Most (91.4%) participants were of non-Hispanic or non-Latin \nethnicity.  \nAntibody responses to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (PT, FHA, PRN and FIM), poliovirus types \n1, 2 and 3, hepatitis B and H. influenzae type b antigens were measured in sera obtained one \nmonth following the third dose of VAXELIS or Pentacel + RECOMBIVAX HB vaccines. \nVAXELIS was non-inferior to Pentacel + RECOMBIVAX HB administered concomitantly at \nseparate sites, as demonstrated by the proportions of participants achieving seroprotective levels \nof antibodies to diphtheria, tetanus, poliovirus, hepatitis B and PRP antigens, and pertussis \nvaccine response rates and GMCs (except FHA), following 3 doses of the vaccine. See Table 3.  \nTo complete the 4-dose pertussis primary vaccination series, participants in both groups received \nDAPTACEL at 15 months of age and were evaluated for immune responses to pertussis antigens \none month later. The non-inferiority criteria for vaccine response rates and GMCs for all \npertussis antigens were met following the fourth dose. \n \n \n14 \n \nTable 3: Antibody Responses One Month Following Dose 3 of VAXELIS or Control \nVaccines Administered Concomitantly with Prevnar 13 and RotaTeq in Study 005 \n \nVAXELIS  \n+ Prevnar 13 + RotaTeq \n(N=688 - 810) \nPentacel + RECOMBIVAX HB \n+ Prevnar 13 + RotaTeq \n(N=353 - 400) \nAnti-Diphtheria Toxoid \n \n \n% 0.1 IU/mL \n82.4* \n86.3 \nAnti-Tetanus Toxoid \n \n \n% 0.1 IU/mL \n99.9† \n99.5 \nAnti-PT \n \n \n% vaccine response‡ \n98.1* \n98.5 \nGMC \n109.6§ \n85.4 \nAnti-FHA \n \n \n% vaccine response‡ \n87.3* \n92.0 \nGMC \n46.6¶ \n72.3 \nAnti-PRN \n \n \n% vaccine response‡  \n79.3* \n82.0 \nGMC \n55.8§ \n66.8 \nAnti-FIM \n \n \n% vaccine response‡ \n90.2* \n86.2 \nGMC \n235.9§ \n184.4 \nAnti-Poliovirus Type 1 \n \n \n% ≥1:8 dilution \n100.0† \n98.2 \nAnti-Poliovirus Type 2 \n \n \n% ≥1:8 dilution \n100.0† \n99.7 \nAnti-Poliovirus Type 3 \n \n \n% ≥1:8 dilution \n100.0† \n99.8 \nAnti-PRP \n \n \n% ≥0.15 μg/mL \n97.3† \n92.4 \n% ≥1.0 μg/mL \n85.0* \n75.3 \nAnti-HBsAg \n \n \n% 10 mIU/mL \n99.4* \n98.6 \nN = The number of participants with available data. \n* Non-inferiority criterion met (lower bound of 2-sided 95% CI for the difference [VAXELIS group minus Control \nvaccines group] was >-10%). \n† Non-inferiority criterion met (lower bound of 2-sided 95% CI for the difference [VAXELIS group minus Control \nvaccines group] was >-5%). \n \n \n15 \n \n‡ Vaccine response = if pre-vaccination antibody concentration was <4 x lower limit of quantitation [LLOQ], then \nthe post-vaccination antibody concentration was ≥4 x LLOQ; if pre-vaccination antibody concentration was \n≥4 x LLOQ, then the post-vaccination antibody concentration was ≥pre-vaccination levels (pre-Dose 1). \n§ Non-inferiority criterion met (lower bound of 2-sided 95% CI for the GMC ratio [VAXELIS group/Control \nvaccines group] was >0.67). \n¶  Non-inferiority criterion not met for anti-FHA GMC (lower bound of 2-sided 95% CI for the GMC ratio \n[VAXELIS group/Control vaccines group was 0.59 which is below the non-inferiority criterion >0.67). \nStudy 006 (Table 1) was a lot consistency study conducted in the US, where infants were \nrandomized to receive 3 doses of VAXELIS at 2, 4, and 6 months of age and Pentacel at 15 \nmonths of age (N=2,406), or control group vaccines (4 doses of Pentacel at 2, 4, 6, and 15 \nmonths of age + RECOMBIVAX HB at 2 and 6 months of age; N=402). All subjects received \nconcomitant vaccines: RotaTeq at 2, 4 and 6 months and Prevnar 13 at 2, 4, 6, and 15 months of \nage.  All infants had received a dose of hepatitis B vaccine prior to study initiation, from birth up \nto one month of age.  \nAntibody responses to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (PT, FHA, PRN and FIM), poliovirus types \n1, 2 and 3, hepatitis B and H. influenzae type b antigens were measured in sera obtained one \nmonth following the third dose of VAXELIS or Pentacel + RECOMBIVAX HB. VAXELIS was \nnon-inferior to Pentacel + RECOMBIVAX HB administered concomitantly at separate sites, as \ndemonstrated by the proportions of participants achieving seroprotective levels of antibodies to \ndiphtheria, tetanus, poliovirus, hepatitis B and PRP antigens, and pertussis vaccine response rates \nand GMCs, except for GMCs for FHA (lower bound of 2-sided 95% CI for GMC ratio \n[VAXELIS group/Control group vaccines] was 0.62, which was below the non-inferiority \ncriterion >0.67).  \nTo complete the 4-dose pertussis primary vaccination series, participants in both groups received \nPentacel at 15 months of age and were evaluated for immune responses to pertussis antigens one \nmonth later. The non-inferiority criteria for antibody vaccine response rates and GMCs for all \npertussis antigens were met following the fourth dose except for GMCs for PRN (lower bound of \n2-sided 95% CI for GMC ratio [VAXELIS group/Control group vaccines] was 0.66, which was \nbelow the non-inferiority criterion >0.67). \n14.3 Concomitantly Administered Vaccines  \nIn Study 006 conducted in the US (Table 1), the immune responses to Prevnar 13 were measured \none month after the third dose.

PEDIARIX is approved for use as a 3-dose series in infants \nborn of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative mothers. PEDIARIX \nmay be given as early as 6 weeks of age through 6 years of age (prior to the \nseventh birthday). (1) \n ------------------------- DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION -----------------------  \nThree doses (0.5-mL each) by intramuscular injection at 2, 4, and 6 months of \nage. (2.2) \n ----------------------- DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS ----------------------  \nSingle-dose, prefilled syringes containing a 0.5-mL suspension for injection. \n(3) \n -------------------------------- CONTRAINDICATIONS ------------------------------  \n• \nSevere allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any \ndiphtheria toxoid-, tetanus toxoid-, pertussis-, hepatitis B-, or \npoliovirus-containing vaccine, or to any component of PEDIARIX. (4.1) \n• \nEncephalopathy within 7 days of administration of a previous \npertussis-containing vaccine. (4.2) \n• \nProgressive neurologic disorders. (4.3) \n ------------------------- WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ------------------------  \n• \nIn clinical trials, PEDIARIX was associated with higher rates of fever, \nrelative to separately administered vaccines. (5.1) \n• \nIf Guillain-Barré syndrome occurs within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior \nvaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the decision to give PEDIARIX should \nbe based on potential benefits and risks. (5.2) \n• \nSyncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of \ninjectable vaccines, including PEDIARIX. Procedures should be in place \nto avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following \nsyncope. (5.3) \n• \nIf temperature 105F, collapse or shock-like state, or persistent, \ninconsolable crying lasting 3 hours have occurred within 48 hours after \nreceipt of a pertussis-containing vaccine, or if seizures have occurred \nwithin 3 days after receipt of a pertussis-containing vaccine, the decision \nto give PEDIARIX should be based on potential benefits and risks. (5.4) \n• \nFor children at higher risk for seizures, an antipyretic may be \nadministered at the time of vaccination with PEDIARIX. (5.5) \n• \nApnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some \ninfants born prematurely. Decisions about when to administer an \nintramuscular vaccine, including PEDIARIX, to infants born prematurely \nshould be based on consideration of the individual infant’s medical status \nand the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. (5.6) \n ------------------------------- ADVERSE REACTIONS ------------------------------  \nCommon solicited adverse reactions following any dose (25%) included \nlocal injection site reactions (pain, redness, and swelling), fever (100.4F), \ndrowsiness, irritability/fussiness, and loss of appetite.

PEDIARIX is approved for \n \n2\nuse as a 3-dose series in infants born of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative mothers. \nPEDIARIX may be given as early as 6 weeks of age through 6 years of age (prior to the seventh \nbirthday). \n2 \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  \n2.1 \nPreparation for Administration  \nShake vigorously to obtain a homogeneous, turbid, white suspension. Do not use if resuspension \ndoes not occur with vigorous shaking. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for \nparticulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container \npermit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered. \nAttach a sterile needle and administer intramuscularly. \nThe preferred administration site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh for children younger than \n1 year. In older children, the deltoid muscle is usually large enough for an intramuscular \ninjection. The vaccine should not be injected in the gluteal area or areas where there may be a \nmajor nerve trunk. Gluteal injections may result in suboptimal hepatitis B immune response. \nDo not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously. \n2.2 \nRecommended Dose and Schedule  \nImmunization with PEDIARIX consists of 3 doses of 0.5 mL each by intramuscular injection at \n2, 4, and 6 months of age (at intervals of 6 to 8 weeks, preferably 8 weeks). The first dose may \nbe given as early as 6 weeks of age. Three doses of PEDIARIX constitute a primary \nimmunization course for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and poliomyelitis and the complete \nvaccination course for hepatitis B. \n2.3 \nModified Schedules in Previously Vaccinated Children  \nChildren Previously Vaccinated with Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis \nVaccine Adsorbed (DTaP) \nPEDIARIX may be used to complete the first 3 doses of the DTaP series in children who have \nreceived 1 or 2 doses of INFANRIX (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis \nVaccine Adsorbed), manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, identical to the DTaP component of \nPEDIARIX [see Description (11)] and are also scheduled to receive the other vaccine \ncomponents of PEDIARIX. Data are not available on the safety and effectiveness of using \nPEDIARIX following 1 or more doses of a DTaP vaccine from a different manufacturer. \nChildren Previously Vaccinated with Hepatitis B Vaccine \nPEDIARIX may be used to complete the hepatitis B vaccination series following 1 or 2 doses of \nanother hepatitis B vaccine (monovalent or as part of a combination vaccine), including vaccines \nfrom other manufacturers, in children born of HBsAg-negative mothers who are also scheduled \nto receive the other vaccine components of PEDIARIX. \n \n3\nA 3-dose series of PEDIARIX may be administered to infants born of HBsAg-negative mothers \nand who received a dose of hepatitis B vaccine at or shortly after birth. However, data are limited \nregarding the safety of PEDIARIX in such infants [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There are no \ndata to support the use of a 3-dose series of PEDIARIX in infants who have previously received \nmore than 1 dose of hepatitis B vaccine. \nChildren Previously Vaccinated with Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV) \nPEDIARIX may be used to complete the first 3 doses of the IPV series in children who have \nreceived 1 or 2 doses of IPV from a different manufacturer and are also scheduled to receive the \nother vaccine components of PEDIARIX. \n2.4 \nBooster Immunization following PEDIARIX  \nChildren who have received a 3-dose series with PEDIARIX should complete the DTaP and IPV \nseries according to the recommended schedule.1 Because the pertussis antigens contained in \nINFANRIX and KINRIX (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed \nand Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine), manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, are the same as those in \nPEDIARIX, these children should receive INFANRIX as their fourth dose of DTaP and either \nINFANRIX or KINRIX as their fifth dose of DTaP, according to the respective prescribing \ninformation for these vaccines. KINRIX or another manufacturer’s IPV may be used to complete \nthe 4-dose IPV series according to the respective prescribing information. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nPEDIARIX is a suspension for injection available in 0.5-mL single-dose prefilled TIP-LOK \nsyringes. \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity  \nA severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any diphtheria toxoid-, \ntetanus toxoid-, pertussis antigen-, hepatitis B-, or poliovirus-containing vaccine or any \ncomponent of this vaccine, including yeast, neomycin, and polymyxin B, is a contraindication to \nadministration of PEDIARIX [see Description (11)]. \n4.2 \nEncephalopathy  \nEncephalopathy (e.g., coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) within 7 days \nof administration of a previous dose of a pertussis-containing vaccine that is not attributable to \nanother identifiable cause is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing \nvaccine, including PEDIARIX. \n4.3 \nProgressive Neurologic Disorder  \nProgressive neurologic disorder, including infantile spasms, uncontrolled epilepsy, or \n \n4\nprogressive encephalopathy, is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing \nvaccine, including PEDIARIX. PEDIARIX should not be administered to individuals with such \nconditions until the neurologic status is clarified and stabilized. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nFever  \nIn clinical trials, administration of PEDIARIX in infants was associated with higher rates of \nfever relative to separately administered vaccines [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. \n5.2 \nGuillain-Barré Syndrome  \nIf Guillain-Barré syndrome occurs within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus \ntoxoid, the decision to give PEDIARIX or any vaccine containing tetanus toxoid should be based \non careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks. \n5.3 \nSyncope  \nSyncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including \nPEDIARIX. Syncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual \ndisturbance, paresthesia, and tonic-clonic limb movements. Procedures should be in place to \navoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope. \n5.4 \nAdverse Reactions following Prior Pertussis Vaccination  \nIf any of the following reactions occur in temporal relation to receipt of a vaccine containing a \npertussis component, the decision to give any pertussis-containing vaccine, including \nPEDIARIX, should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks: \n• Temperature of 40.5oC (105oF) within 48 hours not due to another identifiable cause; \n• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours; \n• Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours; \n• Seizures with or without fever occurring within 3 days. \n5.5 \nChildren at Risk for Seizures  \nFor children at higher risk for seizures than the general population, an appropriate antipyretic \nmay be administered at the time of vaccination with a vaccine containing a pertussis component, \nincluding PEDIARIX, and for the ensuing 24 hours to reduce the possibility of post-vaccination \nfever. \n5.6 \nApnea in Premature Infants  \nApnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. \nDecisions about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including PEDIARIX, to infants \nborn prematurely should be based on consideration of the individual infant’s medical status and \nthe potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. \n \n5\n5.7 \nPreventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions  \nPrior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the immunization history for \npossible vaccine sensitivity and previous vaccination-related adverse reactions to allow an \nassessment of benefits and risks. Epinephrine and other appropriate agents used for the control of \nimmediate allergic reactions must be immediately available should an acute anaphylactic \nreaction occur. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nA total of 23,849 doses of PEDIARIX have been administered to 8,088 infants who received 1 or \nmore doses as part of the 3-dose series during 14 clinical studies. Common adverse reactions that \noccurred in 25% of subjects following any dose of PEDIARIX included local injection site \nreactions (pain, redness, and swelling), fever, drowsiness, irritability/fussiness, and loss of \nappetite. In comparative studies (including the German and U.S. studies described below), \nadministration of PEDIARIX was associated with higher rates of fever relative to separately \nadministered vaccines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The prevalence of fever was \nhighest on the day of vaccination and the day following vaccination. More than 96% of episodes \nof fever resolved within the 4-day period following vaccination (i.e., the period including the day \nof vaccination and the next 3 days). \nIn the largest of the 14 studies conducted in Germany, safety data were available for 4,666 \ninfants who received PEDIARIX administered concomitantly at separate sites with 1 of 4 \nHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines (GlaxoSmithKline [licensed in the \nUnited States only for booster immunization], Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc. [no longer licensed in \nthe United States], Sanofi Pasteur SA [U.S.-licensed], or Merck & Co, Inc. [U.S.-licensed]) at 3, \n4, and 5 months of age and for 768 infants in the control group that received separate U.S.-\nlicensed vaccines (INFANRIX, Hib conjugate vaccine [Sanofi Pasteur SA], and oral poliovirus \nvaccine [OPV] [Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; no longer licensed in the United States]). In this \nstudy, information on adverse events that occurred within 30 days following vaccination was \ncollected. More than 95% of study participants were White. \nIn a U.S. study, the safety of PEDIARIX administered to 673 infants was compared with the \nsafety of separately administered INFANRIX, ENGERIX-B [Hepatitis B Vaccine \n(Recombinant)], and IPV (Sanofi Pasteur SA) in 335 infants. In both groups, infants received \nHib conjugate vaccine (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.; no longer licensed in the United States) and \n7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.) concomitantly at \nseparate sites. All vaccines were administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Data on solicited \n \n6\nlocal reactions and general adverse reactions were collected by parents using standardized diary \ncards for 4 consecutive days following each vaccine dose (i.e., day of vaccination and the next \n3 days). Telephone follow-up was conducted 1 month and 6 months after the third vaccination to \ninquire about serious adverse events. At the 6-month follow-up, information also was collected \non new onset of chronic illnesses. A total of 638 subjects who received PEDIARIX and 313 \nsubjects who received INFANRIX, ENGERIX-B, and IPV completed the 6-month follow-up. \nAmong subjects in both study groups combined, 69% were White, 18% were Hispanic, 7% were \nBlack, 3% were Asian, and 3% were of other racial/ethnic groups. \nSolicited Adverse Reactions \nData on solicited local reactions and general adverse reactions from the U.S. safety study are \npresented in Table 1. This study was powered to evaluate fever >101.3F following Dose 1. The \nrate of fever 100.4F following each dose was significantly higher in the group that received \nPEDIARIX compared with separately administered vaccines. Other statistically significant \ndifferences between groups in rates of fever, as well as other solicited adverse reactions, are \nnoted in Table 1. Medical attention (a visit to or from medical personnel) for fever within 4 days \nfollowing vaccination was sought in the group who received PEDIARIX for 8 infants after the \nfirst dose (1.2%), 1 infant following the second dose (0.2%), and 5 infants following the third \ndose (0.8%) (Table 1). Following Dose 2, medical attention for fever was sought for 2 infants \n(0.6%) who received separately administered vaccines (Table 1). Among infants who had a \nmedical visit for fever within 4 days following vaccination, 9 of 14 who received PEDIARIX \nand 1 of 2 who received separately administered vaccines, had 1 or more diagnostic studies \nperformed to evaluate the cause of fever. \n \n7\nTable 1.

Causes of death in \nthe group that received PEDIARIX included 2 cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) \nand 1 case of each of the following: convulsive disorder, congenital immunodeficiency with \nsepsis, and neuroblastoma. One case of SIDS was reported in the comparator group. The rate of \nSIDS among all recipients of PEDIARIX across the 14 trials was 0.25/1,000. The rate of SIDS \nobserved for recipients of PEDIARIX in the German safety study was 0.2/1,000 infants (reported \nrate of SIDS in Germany in the latter part of the 1990s was 0.7/1,000 newborns). The reported \nrate of SIDS in the United States from 1990 to 1994 was 1.2/1,000 live births. By chance alone, \nsome cases of SIDS can be expected to follow receipt of pertussis-containing vaccines. \nOnset of Chronic Illnesses \nIn the U.S. safety study in which all subjects received concomitant Hib and pneumococcal \nconjugate vaccines, 21 subjects (3%) who received PEDIARIX and 14 subjects (4%) who \nreceived INFANRIX, ENGERIX-B, and IPV reported new onset of a chronic illness during the \nperiod from 1 to 6 months following the last dose of study vaccines. Among the chronic illnesses \nreported in the subjects who received PEDIARIX, there were 4 cases of asthma and 1 case each \nof diabetes mellitus and chronic neutropenia. There were 4 cases of asthma in subjects who \nreceived INFANRIX, ENGERIX-B, and IPV. \n \n9\nSeizures \nIn the German safety study over the entire study period, 6 subjects in the group that received \nPEDIARIX (n = 4,666) reported seizures. Two of these subjects had a febrile seizure, 1 of whom \nalso developed afebrile seizures. The remaining 4 subjects had afebrile seizures, including 2 with \ninfantile spasms. Two subjects reported seizures within 7 days following vaccination (1 subject \nhad both febrile and afebrile seizures, and 1 subject had afebrile seizures), corresponding to a \nrate of 0.22 seizures per 1,000 doses (febrile seizures 0.07 per 1,000 doses, afebrile seizures 0.14 \nper 1,000 doses). No subject who received concomitant INFANRIX, Hib vaccine, and OPV \n(n = 768) reported seizures. In a separate German study that evaluated the safety of INFANRIX \nin 22,505 infants who received 66,867 doses of INFANRIX administered as a 3-dose primary \nseries, the rate of seizures within 7 days of vaccination with INFANRIX was 0.13 per 1,000 \ndoses (febrile seizures 0.0 per 1,000 doses, afebrile seizures 0.13 per 1,000 doses). \nOver the entire study period in the U.S. safety study in which all subjects received concomitant \nHib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, 4 subjects in the group that received PEDIARIX \n(n = 673) reported seizures. Three of these subjects had a febrile seizure and 1 had an afebrile \nseizure. Over the entire study period, 2 subjects in the group that received INFANRIX, \nENGERIX-B, and IPV (n = 335) reported febrile seizures. There were no afebrile seizures in this \ngroup. No subject in either study group had seizures within 7 days following vaccination. \nOther Neurological Events of Interest \nNo cases of hypotonic-hyporesponsiveness or encephalopathy were reported in either the \nGerman or U.S. safety studies. \nSafety of PEDIARIX after a Previous Dose of Hepatitis B Vaccine \nLimited data are available on the safety of administering PEDIARIX after a previous dose of \nhepatitis B vaccine. In 2 separate studies, 160 Moldovan infants and 96 U.S. infants, \nrespectively, received 3 doses of PEDIARIX following 1 previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine. \nNeither study was designed to detect significant differences in rates of adverse events associated \nwith PEDIARIX administered after a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine compared with \nPEDIARIX administered without a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine. \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Safety Surveillance Study  \nIn a safety surveillance study conducted at a health maintenance organization in the United \nStates, infants who received 1 or more doses of PEDIARIX from approximately mid-2003 \nthrough mid-2005 were compared with age-, gender-, and area-matched historical controls who \nreceived 1 or more doses of separately administered U.S.-licensed DTaP vaccine from 2002 \nthrough approximately mid-2003. Only infants who received 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate \nvaccine (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.) concomitantly with PEDIARIX or DTaP vaccine were \nincluded in the cohorts. Other U.S.-licensed vaccines were administered according to routine \npractices at the study sites, but concomitant administration with PEDIARIX or DTaP was not a \n \n10\ncriterion for inclusion in the cohorts. A birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine had been administered \nroutinely to infants in the historical DTaP control cohort, but not to infants who received \nPEDIARIX. For each of Doses 1-3, a random sample of 40,000 infants who received PEDIARIX \nwas compared with the historical DTaP control cohort for the incidence of seizures (with or \nwithout fever) during the 8-day period following vaccination. For each dose, random samples of \n7,500 infants in each cohort were also compared for the incidence of medically-attended fever \n(fever 100.4F that resulted in hospitalization, an emergency department visit, or an outpatient \nvisit) during the 4-day period following vaccination. Possible seizures and medical visits \nplausibly related to fever were identified by searching automated inpatient and outpatient data \nfiles. Medical record reviews of identified events were conducted to verify the occurrence of \nseizures or medically-attended fever. The incidence of verified seizures and medically-attended \nfever from this study are presented in Table 2. \nTable 2.

Because these reactions are reported \nvoluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their \nfrequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. \nCardiac Disorders \nCyanosis. \nGastrointestinal Disorders \nDiarrhea, vomiting. \nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \nFatigue, injection site cellulitis, injection site induration, injection site itching, injection site \nnodule/lump, injection site reaction, injection site vesicles, injection site warmth, limb pain, limb \nswelling. \nImmune System Disorders \nAnaphylactic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction, hypersensitivity. \nInfections and Infestations \nUpper respiratory tract infection. \nInvestigations \nAbnormal liver function tests. \nNervous System Disorders \nBulging fontanelle, depressed level of consciousness, encephalitis, hypotonia, hypotonic-\nhyporesponsive episode, lethargy, somnolence, syncope. \nPsychiatric Disorders \nCrying, insomnia, nervousness, restlessness, screaming, unusual crying. \nRespiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \nApnea, cough, dyspnea. \n \n12\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \nAngioedema, erythema, rash, urticaria. \nVascular Disorders \nPallor, petechiae. \n6.4 \nPostmarketing Spontaneous Reports for INFANRIX and/or ENGERIX-B  \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of INFANRIX \nand/or ENGERIX-B in children younger than 7 years but not already reported for PEDIARIX. \nBecause these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not \nalways possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine \nexposure. \nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders \nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,a,b lymphadenopathy,a thrombocytopenia.a,b \nGastrointestinal Disorders \nAbdominal pain,b intussusception,a,b nausea.b \nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \nAsthenia,b malaise.b \nHepatobiliary Disorders \nJaundice.b \nImmune System Disorders \nAnaphylactic shock,a serum sickness–like disease.b \nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders \nArthralgia,b arthritis,b muscular weakness,b myalgia.b \nNervous System Disorders \nEncephalopathy,a headache,a meningitis,b neuritis,b neuropathy,b paralysis.b \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \nAlopecia,b erythema multiforme,b lichen planus,b pruritus,a,b Stevens Johnson syndrome.a \nVascular Disorders \nVasculitis.b \na Following INFANRIX (licensed in the United States in 1997). \nb Following ENGERIX-B (licensed in the United States in 1989). \n \n13\n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 \nConcomitant Vaccine Administration  \nImmune responses following concomitant administration of PEDIARIX, Hib conjugate vaccine \n(Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.; no longer licensed in the U.S.), and 7-valent pneumococcal \nconjugate vaccine (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.) were evaluated in a clinical trial [see Clinical \nStudies (14.3)]. \nWhen PEDIARIX is administered concomitantly with other injectable vaccines, they should be \ngiven with separate syringes and at different injection sites. PEDIARIX should not be mixed \nwith any other vaccine in the same syringe. \n7.2 \nImmunosuppressive Therapies  \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic \ndrugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune \nresponse to PEDIARIX. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nSafety and effectiveness of PEDIARIX were established in the age group 6 weeks through \n6 months on the basis of clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.1, \n14.2)]. Safety and effectiveness of PEDIARIX in the age group 7 months through 6 years are \nsupported by evidence in infants aged 6 weeks through 6 months. Safety and effectiveness of \nPEDIARIX in infants younger than 6 weeks and children aged 7 to 16 years have not been \nevaluated. \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nPEDIARIX [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis B \n(Recombinant) and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine] is a noninfectious, sterile vaccine for \nintramuscular administration. Each 0.5-mL dose is formulated to contain 25 Lf of diphtheria \ntoxoid, 10 Lf of tetanus toxoid, 25 mcg of inactivated pertussis toxin (PT), 25 mcg of \nfilamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), 8 mcg of pertactin (69 kiloDalton outer membrane protein), \n10 mcg of HBsAg, 40 D-antigen Units (DU) of Type 1 poliovirus (Mahoney), 8 DU of Type 2 \npoliovirus (MEF-1), and 32 DU of Type 3 poliovirus (Saukett). The diphtheria, tetanus, and \npertussis components are the same as those in INFANRIX and KINRIX. The hepatitis B surface \nantigen is the same as that in ENGERIX-B. \nThe diphtheria toxin is produced by growing Corynebacterium diphtheriae (C. diphtheriae) in \nFenton medium containing a bovine extract. Tetanus toxin is produced by growing Clostridium \ntetani (C. tetani) in a modified Latham medium derived from bovine casein. The bovine \nmaterials used in these extracts are sourced from countries which the United States Department \n \n14\nof Agriculture (USDA) has determined neither have nor present an undue risk for bovine \nspongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Both toxins are detoxified with formaldehyde, concentrated \nby ultrafiltration, and purified by precipitation, dialysis, and sterile filtration. \nThe acellular pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, and pertactin) are isolated from Bordetella pertussis \n(B. pertussis) culture grown in modified Stainer-Scholte liquid medium. PT and FHA are \nisolated from the fermentation broth; pertactin is extracted from the cells by heat treatment and \nflocculation. The antigens are purified in successive chromatographic and precipitation steps. PT \nis detoxified using glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde. FHA and pertactin are treated with \nformaldehyde. \nThe hepatitis B surface antigen is obtained by culturing genetically engineered Saccharomyces \ncerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) cells, which carry the surface antigen gene of the hepatitis B virus, in \nsynthetic medium. The surface antigen expressed in the S. cerevisiae cells is purified by several \nphysiochemical steps, which include precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, and \nultrafiltration. \nThe inactivated poliovirus component is an enhanced potency component. Each of the 3 strains \nof poliovirus is individually grown in VERO cells, a continuous line of monkey kidney cells, \ncultivated on microcarriers. Calf serum and lactalbumin hydrolysate are used during VERO cell \nculture and/or virus culture. Calf serum is sourced from countries the USDA has determined \nneither have nor present an undue risk for BSE. After clarification, each viral suspension is \npurified by ultrafiltration, diafiltration, and successive chromatographic steps, and inactivated \nwith formaldehyde. The 3 purified viral strains are then pooled to form a trivalent concentrate. \nDiphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis antigens (inactivated PT, FHA, and pertactin) are \nindividually adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide. The hepatitis B component is adsorbed onto \naluminum phosphate. \nDiphtheria and tetanus toxoid potency is determined by measuring the amount of neutralizing \nantitoxin in previously immunized guinea pigs. The potency of the acellular pertussis component \n(inactivated PT, FHA, and pertactin) is determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \n(ELISA) on sera from previously immunized mice. Potency of the hepatitis B component is \nestablished by HBsAg ELISA. The potency of the inactivated poliovirus component is \ndetermined by using the D-antigen ELISA and by a poliovirus-neutralizing cell culture assay on \nsera from previously immunized rats. \nEach 0.5-mL dose contains aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate as adjuvants \n(formulated to contain 0.7 mg aluminum) and ≤4.4 mg of sodium chloride. The aluminum \ncontent is measured by assay. Each dose also contains 100 mcg of residual formaldehyde and \n100 mcg of polysorbate 80 (Tween 80). Neomycin sulfate and polymyxin B sulfate are used in \nthe poliovirus vaccine manufacturing process and may be present in the final vaccine at 0.05 ng \nneomycin and 0.01 ng polymyxin B per dose. The procedures used to manufacture the HBsAg \nantigen result in a product that contains 5% yeast protein. \n \n15\nThe tip cap and rubber plunger stopper of the prefilled syringe are not made with natural rubber \nlatex. \nPEDIARIX is formulated without preservatives. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action  \nDiphtheria \nDiphtheria is an acute toxin-mediated infectious disease caused by toxigenic strains of C. \ndiphtheriae. Protection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to the \ndiphtheria toxin. A serum diphtheria antitoxin level of 0.01 IU/mL is the lowest level giving \nsome degree of protection; a level of 0.1 IU/mL is regarded as protective.2 \nTetanus \nTetanus is an acute toxin-mediated disease caused by a potent exotoxin released by C. tetani. \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to the tetanus \ntoxin. A serum tetanus antitoxin level of at least 0.01 IU/mL, measured by neutralization assays, \nis considered the minimum protective level.3,4 A level 0.1 IU/mL is considered protective.5 \nPertussis \nPertussis (whooping cough) is a disease of the respiratory tract caused by B. pertussis. The role \nof the different components produced by B. pertussis in either the pathogenesis of, or the \nimmunity to, pertussis is not well understood. There is no established serological correlate of \nprotection for pertussis. \nHepatitis B \nInfection with hepatitis B virus can have serious consequences including acute massive hepatic \nnecrosis and chronic active hepatitis. Chronically infected persons are at increased risk for \ncirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. \nAntibody concentrations 10 mIU/mL against HBsAg are recognized as conferring protection \nagainst hepatitis B virus infection.6 \nPoliomyelitis \nPoliovirus is an enterovirus that belongs to the picornavirus family. Three serotypes of poliovirus \nhave been identified (Types 1, 2, and 3). Poliovirus-neutralizing antibodies confer protection \nagainst poliomyelitis disease.7 \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nPEDIARIX has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or for impairment of \n \n16\nfertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \nThe efficacy of PEDIARIX is based on the immunogenicity of the individual antigens compared \nwith licensed vaccines. Serological correlates of protection exist for the diphtheria, tetanus, \nhepatitis B, and poliovirus components. The efficacy of the pertussis component, which does not \nhave a well-established correlate of protection, was determined in clinical trials of INFANRIX. \n14.1 \nEfficacy of INFANRIX  \nEfficacy of a 3-dose primary series of INFANRIX has been assessed in 2 clinical studies. \nA double-blind, randomized, active Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids (DT)-controlled trial \nconducted in Italy, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), assessed the absolute \nprotective efficacy of INFANRIX when administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The \npopulation used in the primary analysis of the efficacy of INFANRIX included 4,481 infants \nvaccinated with INFANRIX and 1,470 DT vaccinees. After 3 doses, the absolute protective \nefficacy of INFANRIX against WHO-defined typical pertussis (21 days or more of paroxysmal \ncough with infection confirmed by culture and/or serologic testing) was 84% (95% CI: 76%, \n89%). When the definition of pertussis was expanded to include clinically milder disease, with \ninfection confirmed by culture and/or serologic testing, the efficacy of INFANRIX was 71% \n(95% CI: 60%, 78%) against >7 days of any cough and 73% (95% CI: 63%, 80%) against \n14 days of any cough. A longer unblinded follow-up period showed that after 3 doses and with \nno booster dose in the second year of life, the efficacy of INFANRIX against WHO-defined \npertussis was 86% (95% CI: 79%, 91%) among children followed to 6 years of age. For details \nsee INFANRIX prescribing information. \nA prospective efficacy trial was also conducted in Germany employing a household contact \nstudy design. In this study, the protective efficacy of INFANRIX administered to infants at 3, 4, \nand 5 months of age against WHO-defined pertussis was 89% (95% CI: 77%, 95%). When the \ndefinition of pertussis was expanded to include clinically milder disease, with infection \nconfirmed by culture and/or serologic testing, the efficacy of INFANRIX against 7 days of any \ncough was 67% (95% CI: 52%, 78%) and against 7 days of paroxysmal cough was 81% (95% \nCI: 68%, 89%). For details see INFANRIX prescribing information. \n14.2 \nImmunological Evaluation of PEDIARIX  \nIn a U.S. multicenter study, infants were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) a combination vaccine \ngroup that received PEDIARIX concomitantly with Hib conjugate vaccine (Wyeth \nPharmaceuticals Inc.; no longer licensed in the United States) and U.S.-licensed 7-valent \npneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.); (2) a separate vaccine group that \nreceived U.S.-licensed INFANRIX, ENGERIX-B, and IPV (Sanofi Pasteur SA) concomitantly \nwith the same Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines; and (3) a staggered vaccine group that \nreceived PEDIARIX concomitantly with the same Hib conjugate vaccine but with the same \n \n17\npneumococcal conjugate vaccine administered 2 weeks later. The schedule of administration was \n2, 4, and 6 months of age. Infants either did not receive a dose of hepatitis B vaccine prior to \nenrollment or were permitted to receive 1 dose of hepatitis B vaccine administered at least \n30 days prior to enrollment. For the separate vaccine group, ENGERIX-B was not administered \nat 4 months of age to subjects who received a dose of hepatitis B vaccine prior to enrollment. \nAmong subjects in all 3 vaccine groups combined, 84% were White, 7% were Hispanic, 6% \nwere Black, 0.7% were Asian, and 2.4% were of other racial/ethnic groups. \nThe immune responses to the pertussis (PT, FHA, and pertactin), diphtheria, tetanus, poliovirus, \nand hepatitis B antigens were evaluated in sera obtained 1 month (range: 20 to 60 days) after the \nthird dose of PEDIARIX or INFANRIX. Geometric mean antibody concentrations (GMCs) \nadjusted for pre-vaccination values for PT, FHA, and pertactin and the seroprotection rates for \ndiphtheria, tetanus, and the polioviruses among subjects who received PEDIARIX in the \ncombination vaccine group were shown to be non-inferior to those achieved following separately \nadministered vaccines (Table 3). \nBecause of differences in the hepatitis B vaccination schedule among subjects in the study, no \nclinical limit for non-inferiority was pre-defined for the hepatitis B immune response. However, \nin a previous U.S. study, non-inferiority of PEDIARIX relative to separately administered \nINFANRIX, ENGERIX-B, and an oral poliovirus vaccine, with respect to the hepatitis B \nimmune response was demonstrated. \n \n18\nTable 3.

Four doses of Pentacel \nconstitute a primary immunization course against pertussis. Three doses of Pentacel \nconstitute a primary immunization course against diphtheria, tetanus, H. influenzae type \nb invasive disease, and poliomyelitis; the fourth dose is a booster for diphtheria, tetanus, \nH. influenzae type b invasive disease, and poliomyelitis immunizations. [See 14 Clinical \nStudies (14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5).] \nMixed Sequences of Pentacel and other DTaP-containing Vaccines \nPentacel, DAPTACEL (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine \nAdsorbed), Quadracel (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis \nAdsorbed and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine), and VAXELIS (Diphtheria and Tetanus \nToxoids and Acellular Pertussis, Inactivated Poliovirus, Haemophilus b Conjugate and \nHepatitis B Vaccine) contain the same pertussis antigens manufactured by the same \nprocess. The amount of each of the pertussis antigens is the same in Pentacel, \nQuadracel, and VAXELIS. Pentacel contains twice the amount of detoxified pertussis \ntoxin (PT) and four times the amount of filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) as DAPTACEL.  \nPentacel may be used as the fourth dose in the 5-dose DTaP series in children who have \nreceived a 3-dose series of VAXELIS [See CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].  \nPentacel may be used to complete the first 4 doses of the 5-dose DTaP series in infants \nand children who have received 1 or more doses of DAPTACEL and are also scheduled \nto receive the other antigens of Pentacel.  \nChildren who have completed a 4-dose series with Pentacel should receive a fifth dose \nof DTaP vaccine using DAPTACEL or Quadracel at 4-6 years of age. (1) (2) \nData are not available on the safety and effectiveness of using mixed sequences of \nPentacel and DTaP vaccine from different manufacturers. \nMixed Sequences of Pentacel and IPV Vaccine \nPentacel may be used in infants and children who have received 1 or more doses of \nanother licensed IPV vaccine and are scheduled to receive the antigens of Pentacel. \nHowever, data are not available on the safety and immunogenicity of Pentacel in such \ninfants and children.  \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n242 – Pentacel® \n \n3 \nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that the final \ndose in the 4-dose IPV series be administered at age ≥4 years. (3) When Pentacel is \nadministered at ages 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months, an additional booster dose of IPV \nvaccine should be administered at age 4-6 years, resulting in a 5-dose IPV series. (3) \nMixed Sequences of Pentacel and Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine \nPentacel may be used to complete the vaccination series in infants and children \npreviously vaccinated with one or more doses of Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine \n(either separately administered or as part of another combination vaccine), who are also \nscheduled to receive the other antigens of Pentacel. However, data are not available on \nthe safety and immunogenicity of Pentacel in such infants and children. If different \nbrands of Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccines are administered to complete the series, \nthree primary immunizing doses are needed, followed by a booster dose. \n2.2 \nAdministration  \nThe package contains a vial of the DTaP-IPV component and a vial of lyophilized ActHIB \nvaccine component. \nBefore use, thoroughly but gently shake the vial of DTaP-IPV component, withdraw the \nentire liquid content and inject into the vial of the lyophilized ActHIB vaccine component. \nGently swirl the vial now containing Pentacel until a cloudy, uniform, white to off-white \n(yellow tinge) suspension results.  \nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \ndiscoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If these \nconditions exist, Pentacel should not be administered.  \nWithdraw and administer a single 0.5 mL dose of Pentacel intramuscularly. Pentacel \nshould be used immediately after reconstitution. Discard unused portion. Refer to \nFigures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.\nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n242 – Pentacel® \n \n4 \nPentacel: Instructions for Reconstitution of ActHIB Vaccine Component with \nDTaP-IPV Component \n \nIn infants younger than 1 year, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh provides the largest \nmuscle and is the preferred site of injection. In older children, the deltoid muscle is \nusually large enough for injection. The vaccine should not be injected into the gluteal \narea or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk.  \nDo not administer this product intravenously or subcutaneously. \nPentacel should not be mixed in the same syringe with other parenteral products. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nPentacel is a suspension for injection (0.5 mL dose) supplied as a liquid vaccine \ncomponent that is combined through reconstitution with a lyophilized vaccine component, \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n242 – Pentacel® \n \n5 \nboth in single-dose vials. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) and How \nSupplied/Storage and Handling (16).] \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity  \nA severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of Pentacel or any \nother diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, or pertussis-containing vaccine, inactivated \npoliovirus vaccine or H. influenzae type b vaccine, or any ingredient of this vaccine is a \ncontraindication to administration of Pentacel. [See Description (11).]  \n4.2 \nEncephalopathy  \nEncephalopathy (eg, coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) \nwithin 7 days of a previous dose of a pertussis containing vaccine that is not attributable \nto another identifiable cause is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-\ncontaining vaccine, including Pentacel.  \n4.3 \nProgressive Neurologic Disorder  \nProgressive neurologic disorder, including infantile spasms, uncontrolled epilepsy, or \nprogressive encephalopathy is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-\ncontaining vaccine including Pentacel. Pertussis vaccine should not be administered to \nindividuals with such conditions until a treatment regimen has been established and the \ncondition has stabilized. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nManagement of Acute Allergic Reactions  \nEpinephrine hydrochloride solution (1:1,000) and other appropriate agents and \nequipment must be available for immediate use in case an anaphylactic or acute \nhypersensitivity reaction occurs.  \n5.2 \nAdverse Reactions Following Prior Pertussis Vaccination  \nIf any of the following events occur within the specified period after administration of a \npertussis vaccine, the decision to administer Pentacel should be based on careful \nconsideration of potential benefits and possible risks. \n• Temperature of 40.5°C (105°F) within 48 hours, not attributable to another \nidentifiable cause. \n• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (HHE)) within 48 \nhours. \n• Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours within 48 hours. \n• Seizures with or without fever within 3 days. \n5.3 \nGuillain-Barré Syndrome and Brachial Neuritis  \nA review by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found evidence for a causal relation between \ntetanus toxoid and both brachial neuritis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. (4) If Guillain-\nBarré syndrome occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus \ntoxoid, the risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome may be increased following Pentacel.  \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n242 – Pentacel® \n \n6 \n5.4 \nInfants and Children with a History of Previous Seizures  \nFor infants or children with a history of previous seizures, an appropriate antipyretic may \nbe administered (in the dosage recommended in its prescribing information) at the time \nof vaccination with a vaccine containing acellular pertussis antigens (including Pentacel) \nand for the following 24 hours, to reduce the possibility of post-vaccination fever.  \n5.5 \nLimitations of Vaccine Effectiveness  \nVaccination with Pentacel may not protect all individuals.  \n5.6 \nAltered Immunocompetence  \nIf Pentacel is administered to immunocompromised persons, including persons receiving \nimmunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained. [See \nDrug Interactions (7.2).] \n5.7 \nApnea in Premature Infants  \nApnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born \nprematurely. The decision about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including \nPentacel, to an infant born prematurely should be based on consideration of the \nindividual infant’s medical status and the potential benefits and possible risks of \nvaccination. \n5.8 \nSyncope  \nSyncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines     \nincluding Pentacel. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \nRates of adverse reactions varied by dose number. The most frequent (>50% of \nparticipants) systemic reactions following any dose were fussiness/irritability and \ninconsolable crying. The most frequent (>30% of participants) injection site reactions \nfollowing any dose were tenderness and increased circumference of the injected arm. \n6.1 \nData from Clinical Studies  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction \nrates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in \nthe clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nThe adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for \nidentifying the adverse events that appear to be related to vaccine use and for \napproximating rates of those events. \nThe safety of Pentacel was evaluated in four clinical studies in which a total of 5,980 \nparticipants received at least one dose of Pentacel. In three of the studies, conducted in \nthe US, a total of 4,198 participants were enrolled to receive four consecutive doses of \nPentacel. In the fourth study, conducted in Canada, 1,782 participants previously \nvaccinated with three doses of Pentacel received a fourth dose. The vaccination \nschedules of Pentacel, Control vaccines, and concomitantly administered vaccines used \nin these studies are provided in Table 1. \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n242 – Pentacel® \n \n7 \nAcross the four studies, 50.8% of participants were female. Among participants in the \nthree US studies, 64.5% were Caucasian, 9.2% were Black, 12.9% were Hispanic, 3.9% \nwere Asian, and 9.5% were of other racial/ethnic groups. In the two controlled studies, \nthe racial/ethnic distribution of participants who received Pentacel and Control vaccines \nwas similar. In the Canadian fourth dose study, 86.0% of participants were Caucasian, \n1.9% were Black, 0.8% were Hispanic, 4.3% were Asian, 2.0% were East Indian, 0.5% \nwere Native Indian, and 4.5% were of other racial/ethnic groups. \nTable 1: Clinical Safety Studies of Pentacel: Vaccination Schedules \nStudy \nPentacel \nControl Vaccines \nConcomitantly Administered Vaccines \n494-01 \n2, 4, 6 and 15 \nmonths \nHCPDT + \nPOLIOVAX + \nActHIB at 2, 4, 6, \nand 15 months \n7-valent pneumococcal conjugate \nvaccine* (PCV7) at 2, 4, and 6 months in \na subset of participants† \nHepatitis B vaccine at 2 and 6 months‡ \nP3T06 \n2, 4, 6, and \n15-16 months \nDAPTACEL + IPOL \n+ ActHIB at 2, 4, \nand 6 months; and  \nDAPTACEL + \nActHIB at 15-16 \nmonths \nPCV7* at 2, 4, and 6 months \n \nHepatitis B vaccine at 2 and 6 months‡ \n494-03 \n2, 4, 6, and \n15-16 months \nNone \nPCV7* at 2, 4, and 6 months in all \nparticipants; and at 15 months in a \nrandom subset of participants \nHepatitis B vaccine at 2 and 6 months (if \na dose was previously administered)‡ or \nat 2, 4, and 6 months (if no previous \ndose)   \nMeasles, mumps, rubella vaccine§ (MMR) \nand varicella§ vaccine at 12 or 15 months \nin random subsets of participants \n5A9908 \n15-18 months¶ \nNone \nNone \n \nHCPDT: non-US licensed DTaP vaccine that is identical to the DTaP component of Pentacel. \nPOLIOVAX: US licensed Poliovirus Vaccine Inactivated, Sanofi Pasteur Limited.  \nIPOL: US licensed Poliovirus Vaccine Inactivated, Sanofi Pasteur SA. \n*  \nPCV7 manufactured by Wyeth Laboratories. \n†  \nPCV7 was introduced after the study was initiated, and thus, administered concomitantly with Pentacel \nvaccine in a subset of participants. \n‡ \nThe first dose of hepatitis B vaccine (manufacturer not specified) was administered prior to study \ninitiation, from birth to 21 days of age.

In Studies 494-\n01, 494-03, and 5A9908, a question about the occurrence of fainting or change in mental \nstatus was asked during post-vaccination phone calls. Across these 4 studies, no HHEs, \nas defined in a report of a US Public Health Service workshop (6) were reported among \nparticipants who received Pentacel (N = 5,979), separately administered HCPDT + \nPOLIOVAX + ActHIB (N = 1,032) or separately administered DAPTACEL + IPOL + \nActHIB (N = 1,455). Hypotonia not fulfilling HHE criteria within 7 days following \nvaccination was reported in 4 participants after the administration of Pentacel (1 on the \nsame day as the 1st dose; 3 on the same day as the 3rd dose) and in 1 participant after \nthe administration of DAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB (4 days following the 1st dose). \nSeizures \nAcross Studies 494-01, 494-03, 5A9908 and P3T06, a total of 8 participants experienced \na seizure within 7 days following either Pentacel (4 participants; N = 4,197 for at least \none of Doses 1-3; N = 5,033 for Dose 4), separately administered HCPDT + POLIOVAX \n+ ActHIB (3 participants; N = 1,032 for at least one of Doses 1-3, N = 739 for Dose 4), \nseparately administered DAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB (1 participant; N = 1,455 for at \nleast one of Doses 1-3), or separately administered DAPTACEL + ActHIB (0 participants; \nN = 418 for Dose 4). Among the four participants who experienced a seizure within 7 \ndays following Pentacel, one participant in Study 494-01 had an afebrile seizure 6 days \nafter the first dose, one participant in Study 494-01 had a possible seizure the same day \nas the third dose, and two participants in Study 5A9908 had a febrile seizure 2 and 4 \ndays, respectively, after the fourth dose. Among the four participants who experienced a \nseizure within 7 days following Control vaccines, one participant had an afebrile seizure \nthe same day as the first dose of DAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB, one participant had an \nafebrile seizure the same day as the second dose of HCPDT + POLIOVAX + ActHIB, \nand two participants had a febrile seizure 6 and 7 days, respectively, after the fourth \ndose of HCPDT + POLIOVAX + ActHIB. \nSerious Adverse Events \nIn Study P3T06, within 30 days following any of Doses 1-3 of Pentacel or Control \nvaccines, 19 of 484 (3.9%) participants who received Pentacel and 50 of 1,455 (3.4%) \nparticipants who received DAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB experienced a serious adverse \nevent. Within 30 days following Dose 4 of Pentacel or Control vaccines, 5 of 431 (1.2%) \nparticipants who received Pentacel and 4 of 418 (1.0%) participants who received \nDAPTACEL + ActHIB experienced a serious adverse event. In Study 494-01, within 30 \ndays following any of Doses 1-3 of Pentacel or Control vaccines, 23 of 2,506 (0.9%) \nparticipants who received Pentacel and 11 of 1,032 (1.1%) participants who received \nHCPDT + POLIOVAX + ActHIB experienced a serious adverse event.

Across Studies \n494-01, 494-03, 5A9908 and P3T06, within 30 days following Dose 4 of Pentacel or \nControl vaccines, overall, the most frequently reported serious adverse events were \ndehydration, gastroenteritis, asthma, and pneumonia. \nAcross Studies 494-01, 494-03, 5A9908 and P3T06, two cases of encephalopathy were \nreported, both in participants who had received Pentacel (N = 5,979). One case occurred \n30 days post-vaccination and was secondary to cardiac arrest following cardiac surgery. \nOne infant who had onset of neurologic symptoms 8 days post-vaccination was \nsubsequently found to have structural cerebral abnormalities and was diagnosed with \ncongenital encephalopathy. \nA total of 5 deaths occurred during Studies 494-01, 494-03, 5A9908 and P3T06: 4 in \nchildren who had received Pentacel (N = 5,979) and one in a participant who had \nreceived DAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB (N = 1,455). There were no deaths reported in \nchildren who received HCPDT + POLIOVAX + ActHIB (N = 1,032). Causes of death \namong children who received Pentacel were asphyxia due to suffocation, head trauma, \nSudden Infant Death syndrome, and neuroblastoma (8, 23, 52 and 256 days post-\nvaccination, respectively). One participant with ependymoma died secondary to \naspiration 222 days following DAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB. \n6.2 \n Postmarketing Experience  \nThe following additional adverse events have been spontaneously reported during the \npost-marketing use of Pentacel worldwide, since 1997. Between 1997 and 2007, \nPentacel was primarily used in Canada. Because these events are reported voluntarily \nfrom a population of uncertain size, it may not be possible to reliably estimate their \nfrequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.  \nThe following adverse events were included based on one or more of the following \nfactors: severity, frequency of reporting, or strength of evidence for a causal relationship \nto Pentacel.  \n• Cardiac disorders  \n \nCyanosis  \n• Gastrointestinal disorders \n \nVomiting, diarrhea \n• General disorders and administration site conditions  \n \nInjection site reactions (including inflammation, mass, abscess and sterile \nabscess), extensive swelling of the injected limb (including swelling that involved \nadjacent joints), vaccination failure/therapeutic response decreased (invasive \nH. influenzae type b disease)  \n• Immune system disorders  \n \nAnaphylaxis/anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity (such as rash and urticaria) \n• Infections and infestations \n \nMeningitis, rhinitis, viral infection \n• Metabolism and nutrition disorders \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n242 – Pentacel® \n \n14 \n \nDecreased appetite \n• Nervous system disorders \n \nSomnolence, HHE, depressed level of consciousness \n• Psychiatric disorders \n \nScreaming \n• Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nApnea, cough \n• Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \n \nErythema, skin discoloration \n• Vascular disorders \n \nPallor \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 \nConcomitant Administration with Other Vaccines  \nIn clinical trials, Pentacel was administered concomitantly with one or more of the \nfollowing US licensed vaccines: hepatitis B vaccine, 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate \nvaccine, MMR and varicella vaccines. [See Adverse Reactions (5) and Clinical Studies \n(14).] When Pentacel is given at the same time as another injectable vaccine(s), the \nvaccine(s) should be administered with different syringes and at different injection sites.  \n7.2 \nImmunosuppressive Treatments  \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, \ncytotoxic drugs and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce \nthe immune response to Pentacel. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6).]  \n7.3 \nDrug/Laboratory Test Interactions  \nAntigenuria has been detected in some instances following receipt of ActHIB. Urine \nantigen detection may not have definite diagnostic value in suspected H. influenzae type \nb disease within one week following receipt of Pentacel. (6) \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.4  \nPediatric Use  \nThe safety and effectiveness of Pentacel was established in the age group 6 weeks \nthrough 18 months on the basis of clinical studies. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) and \nClinical Studies (14).] The safety and effectiveness of Pentacel in the age group 19 \nmonths through 4 years is supported by evidence in children 6 weeks through 18 \nmonths. The safety and effectiveness of Pentacel in infants less than 6 weeks of age and \nin children 5 to 16 years of age have not been established. \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n 242 – Pentacel® \n \n15 \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nPentacel consists of a Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis \nAdsorbed and Inactivated Poliovirus (DTaP-IPV) component and an ActHIB® \ncomponent combined through reconstitution for intramuscular injection. ActHIB \n(Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine [Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate]), consists of H. \ninfluenzae type b capsular polysaccharide (polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate [PRP]) \ncovalently bound to tetanus toxoid (PRP-T). The DTaP-IPV component is supplied as a \nsterile liquid used to reconstitute the lyophilized ActHIB component to form Pentacel. \nPentacel is a uniform, cloudy, white to off-white (yellow tinge) suspension.  \nEach 0.5 mL dose contains 15 Lf diphtheria toxoid, 5 Lf tetanus toxoid, acellular \npertussis antigens [20 mcg detoxified pertussis toxin (PT), 20 mcg filamentous \nhemagglutinin (FHA), 3 mcg pertactin (PRN), 5 mcg fimbriae types 2 and 3 (FIM)], \ninactivated polioviruses  \n[40 D-antigen units (DU) Type 1 (Mahoney), 8 DU Type 2 (MEF-1), 32 DU Type 3 \n(Saukett)] and 10 mcg PRP of H. influenzae type b covalently bound to 24 mcg of \ntetanus toxoid (PRP-T). \nOther ingredients per 0.5 mL dose include 1.5 mg aluminum phosphate (0.33 mg \naluminum) as the adjuvant, polysorbate 80 (approximately 10 ppm by calculation), 42.5 \nmg sucrose, <2 mcg residual formaldehyde, <50 ng residual glutaraldehyde, ≤50 ng \nresidual bovine serum albumin, 3.3 mg (0.6% v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol (not as a \npreservative), <4 pg of neomycin and <4 pg polymyxin B sulfate.  \nCorynebacterium diphtheriae is grown in modified Mueller’s growth medium. (7) After \npurification by ammonium sulfate fractionation, the diphtheria toxin is detoxified with \nformaldehyde and diafiltered.  \nClostridium tetani is grown in modified Mueller-Miller casamino acid medium without \nbeef heart infusion. (8) Tetanus toxin is detoxified with formaldehyde and purified by \nammonium sulfate fractionation and diafiltration. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are \nindividually adsorbed onto aluminum phosphate. \nThe acellular pertussis vaccine antigens are produced from Bordetella pertussis \ncultures grown in Stainer-Scholte medium (9) modified by the addition of casamino \nacids and dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin. PT, FHA and PRN are isolated separately from \nthe supernatant culture medium. FIM are extracted and copurified from the bacterial \ncells. The pertussis antigens are purified by sequential filtration, salt-precipitation, \nultrafiltration and chromatography. PT is detoxified with glutaraldehyde. FHA is treated \nwith formaldehyde and the residual aldehydes are removed by ultrafiltration. The \nindividual antigens are adsorbed separately onto aluminum phosphate. \nPoliovirus Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 are each grown in separate cultures of MRC-5 \ncells, a line of normal human diploid cells, by the microcarrier method. (10) (11) The \ncells are grown in CMRL (Connaught Medical Research Laboratories) 1969 medium, \nsupplemented with calf serum. For viral growth, the culture medium is replaced by \nMedium 199, without calf serum. After clarification and filtration, the viral suspensions \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n 242 – Pentacel® \n \n16 \nare concentrated by ultrafiltration, and purified by liquid chromatography steps. The \nmonovalent viral suspensions are inactivated with formaldehyde. Monovalent \nconcentrates of each inactivated poliovirus are combined to produce a trivalent \npoliovirus concentrate.  \nThe adsorbed diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis antigens are combined with \naluminum phosphate (as adjuvant), 2-phenoxyethanol (not as a preservative) and water \nfor injection, into an intermediate concentrate. The trivalent poliovirus concentrate is \nadded and the DTaP-IPV component is diluted to its final concentration. The DTaP-IPV \ncomponent does not contain a preservative. \nBoth diphtheria and tetanus toxoids induce at least 2 neutralizing units per mL in the \nguinea pig potency test. The potency of the acellular pertussis antigens is evaluated by \nthe antibody response of immunized mice to detoxified PT, FHA, PRN and FIM as \nmeasured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The potency of inactivated \npoliovirus antigens is determined by measuring antibody-mediated neutralization of \npoliovirus in sera from immunized rats. \nPRP, a high molecular weight polymer, is prepared from the Haemophilus influenzae \ntype b strain 1482 grown in a semi-synthetic medium. (12) The tetanus toxoid for \nconjugation to PRP is prepared by ammonium sulfate purification, and formalin \ninactivation of the toxin from cultures of Clostridium tetani (Harvard strain) grown in a \nmodified Mueller and Miller medium. (13) The toxoid is filter sterilized prior to the \nconjugation process. The ActHIB component does not contain a preservative. Potency \nof the ActHIB component is specified on each lot by limits on the content of PRP \npolysaccharide and protein per dose and the proportion of polysaccharide and protein \nthat is characterized as high molecular weight conjugate.  \nThe vial stoppers for the DTaP-IPV and ActHIB components of Pentacel are not made \nwith natural rubber latex. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action  \nDiphtheria  \nDiphtheria is an acute toxin-mediated disease caused by toxigenic strains of C. \ndiphtheriae. Protection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing \nantibodies to diphtheria toxin. A serum diphtheria antitoxin level of 0.01 IU/mL is the \nlowest level giving some degree of protection. Antitoxin levels of at least 0.1 IU/mL are \ngenerally regarded as protective. (14) Levels of 1.0 IU/mL have been associated with \nlong-term protection. (15) \nTetanus \nTetanus is an acute disease caused by an extremely potent neurotoxin produced by C. \ntetani. Protection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to \ntetanus toxin. A serum tetanus antitoxin level of at least 0.01 IU/mL, measured by \nneutralization assay is considered the minimum protective level. (14) (16) A tetanus \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n 242 – Pentacel® \n \n17 \nantitoxoid level ≥0.1 IU/mL as measured by the ELISA used in clinical studies of \nPentacel is considered protective. \nPertussis \nPertussis (whooping cough) is a respiratory disease caused by B. pertussis. This Gram-\nnegative coccobacillus produces a variety of biologically active components, though \ntheir role in either the pathogenesis of, or immunity to, pertussis has not been clearly \ndefined.  \nPoliomyelitis \nPolioviruses, of which there are three serotypes (Types 1, 2, and 3) are enteroviruses. \nThe presence of poliovirus type-specific neutralizing antibodies has been correlated with \nprotection against poliomyelitis. (17) \nInvasive Disease Due to H. influenzae Type b \nH. influenzae type b can cause invasive disease such as meningitis and sepsis. Anti-\nPRP antibody has been shown to correlate with protection against invasive disease due \nto H. influenzae type b.  \nBased on data from passive antibody studies (18) and an efficacy study with H. \ninfluenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine in Finland, (19) a post-vaccination anti-PRP \nlevel of 0.15 mcg/mL has been accepted as a minimal protective level. Data from an \nefficacy study with H. influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine in Finland indicate that a \nlevel >1.0 mcg/mL 3 weeks after vaccination predicts protection through a subsequent \none-year period. (20) (21) These levels have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of \nHaemophilus b Conjugate Vaccines, including the ActHIB component of Pentacel.  \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nPentacel has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment \nof fertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \nThe efficacy of Pentacel is based on the immunogenicity of the individual antigens \ncompared to separately administered vaccines. Serological correlates of protection exist \nfor diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, and invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b. \n[See Clinical Pharmacology (12.1).] The efficacy against pertussis, for which there is no \nwell established serological correlate of protection, was based, in part, on a comparison \nof pertussis immune responses following Pentacel in US children to responses following \nDAPTACEL (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed \n(DTaP) manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Limited) in an efficacy study conducted in \nSweden (Sweden I Efficacy Trial). While Pentacel and DAPTACEL contain the same \npertussis antigens, manufactured by the same process, Pentacel contains twice as \nmuch detoxified PT and four times as much FHA as DAPTACEL. \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n 242 – Pentacel® \n \n18 \nImmune responses to Pentacel were evaluated in four US studies: Studies 494-01, \nP3T06, 494-03, and M5A10.

(1) The mean \nlength of follow-up was 2 years after the third dose of vaccine. The protective efficacy of \nDAPTACEL against pertussis after 3 doses of vaccine using the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) case definition (21 consecutive days of paroxysmal cough with \nculture or serologic confirmation or epidemiologic link to a confirmed case) was 84.9% \n(95% confidence interval [CI] 80.1%, 88.6%). The protective efficacy of DAPTACEL \nagainst mild pertussis (1 day of cough with laboratory confirmation) was 77.9% (95% \nCI 72.6%, 82.2%). Protection against pertussis by DAPTACEL was sustained for the 2-\nyear follow-up period.  \nBased on comparisons of the immune responses to DAPTACEL in US infants \n(Post-Dose 3) and Canadian children (Post-Dose 4) relative to infants who participated \nin the Sweden I Efficacy Trial, it was concluded that 4 doses of DAPTACEL were \nneeded for primary immunization against pertussis in US children. (1) \nIn a serology bridging analysis, immune responses to FHA, PRN and FIM in a subset of \ninfants who received three doses of DAPTACEL in the Sweden I Efficacy Trial were \ncompared to the Post-Dose 3 and Post-Dose 4 responses in a subset of US children \nfrom Study 494-01 who received Pentacel (Table 4). Available stored sera from infants \nwho received DAPTACEL in the Sweden I Efficacy Trial and sera from children who \nreceived PCV7 concomitantly with the first three doses of Pentacel in Study 494-01 \n(Table 1) were assayed in parallel. Data on levels of antibody to PT using an adequately \nspecific assay were not available for this serology bridging analysis.  \nGeometric mean antibody concentrations (GMCs) and seroconversion rates for \nantibodies to FHA, PRN and FIM one month following Dose 3 of DAPTACEL in the \nsubset of infants from the Sweden I Efficacy Trial and one month following Dose 3 and \nDose 4 of Pentacel in a subset of infants from US Study 494-01 are presented in Table \n4. Seroconversion was defined as 4-fold rise in antibody level (Post-Dose 3/Pre-Dose 1 \nor Post-Dose 4/Pre-Dose 1). For anti-FHA and anti-FIM, the non-inferiority criteria were \nmet for seroconversion rates, and for anti-FHA, anti-PRN, and anti-FIM, the non-\ninferiority criteria were met for GMCs, following Dose 4 of Pentacel relative to Dose 3 of \nDAPTACEL. The non-inferiority criterion for anti-PRN seroconversion following Dose 4 \nof Pentacel relative to Dose 3 of DAPTACEL was not met [upper limit of 95% CI for \ndifference in rate (DAPTACEL minus Pentacel) = 13.24%]. Whether the lower anti-PRN \nseroconversion rate following Dose 4 of Pentacel in US children relative to Dose 3 of \nDAPTACEL in Swedish infants correlates with diminished efficacy of Pentacel against \npertussis is unknown. \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n 242 – Pentacel® \n \n20 \nTable 4: FHA, PRN and FIM Antibody Responses One Month Following Dose 3 of \nDAPTACEL in a Subset of Infants Vaccinated at 2, 4, and 6 Months of Age in the \nSweden I Efficacy Trial and One Month Following Dose 3 and Dose 4 of Pentacel \nin a Subset of Infants Vaccinated at 2, 4, 6, and 15-16 Months of Age in US Study \n494-01 \n \nPost-Dose 3 \nDAPTACEL  \nSweden I Efficacy \nTrial \nN = 80 \nPost-Dose 3  \nPentacel*  \nUS Study 494-01 \nN = 730-995 \nPost-Dose 4  \nPentacel† \nUS Study 494-01 \nN = 507-554 \nAnti-FHA  \n% achieving 4-fold \nrise‡ \nGMC (EU/mL) \n \n68.8 \n40.70 \n \n79.8 \n71.46 \n \n91.7§ \n129.85§ \nAnti-PRN  \n% achieving 4-fold \nrise‡   \nGMC (EU/mL) \n \n98.8 \n111.26 \n \n74.4 \n38.11 \n \n89.2¶  \n90.82§ \nAnti-FIM  \n% achieving 4-fold \nrise‡ \nGMC (EU/mL)   \n \n86.3 \n339.31 \n \n86.5 \n265.02 \n \n91.5§ \n506.57§ \n \n \nAnalyzed sera were from subsets of the Per Protocol Immunogenicity populations in each study.  \nData on anti-PT levels using an adequately specific assay were not available. \n*  \nNon-inferiority criteria were not pre-specified for the comparisons of immune responses to Pentacel \nvaccine Post-Dose 3 vs. DAPTACEL vaccine Post-Dose 3. \n†  \nPre-specified non-inferiority analyses compared immune responses to Pentacel vaccine Post-Dose 4 \nvs. DAPTACEL vaccine Post-Dose 3. \n‡  \nFold rise was calculated as Post-Dose 3/Pre-Dose 1 antibody level or Post-Dose 4/Pre-Dose 1 \nantibody level. \n§  \nPercent achieving 4-fold rise or GMC Post-Dose 4 Pentacel vaccine is not inferior to Post-Dose 3 \nDAPTACEL vaccine [upper limit of 95% CI for difference in rates (DAPTACEL minus Pentacel) <10% \nand upper limit of 90% CI for GMC ratio (DAPTACEL/Pentacel) <1.5].  \n¶  \nNon-inferiority criterion is not met for percent achieving 4-fold rise in anti-PRN Post-Dose 4 Pentacel \nvaccine relative to Post-Dose 3 DAPTACEL vaccine [upper limit of 95% CI for difference in rates \n(DAPTACEL minus Pentacel) = 13.24%, exceeds the non-inferiority criterion of <10%]. \nIn a separate study, Study P3T06, US infants were randomized to receive either \nPentacel or DAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB at 2, 4, 6, and 15-16 months of age (Table 1). \nThe pertussis immune responses (GMCs and seroconversion rates) one month \nfollowing the third and fourth doses were compared between the two groups (Table 5). \nSeroconversion was defined as a 4-fold rise in antibody level (Post-Dose 3/Pre-Dose 1 \nor Post-Dose 4/Pre-Dose 1).

Because of the potential risk for transmission, it \nshould be prepared, handled, and disposed of as a biohazard material (see PRECAUTIONS and \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). \nBCG infections have been reported in health care workers, primarily from exposures resulting from \naccidental needle sticks or skin lacerations during the preparation of BCG for administration. \nNosocomial infections have been reported in patients receiving parenteral drugs that were prepared in \nareas in which BCG was reconstituted. BCG is capable of dissemination when administered by the \nintravesical route, and serious infections, including fatal infections, have been reported in patients \nreceiving intravesical BCG (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). \nDESCRIPTION \nTICE® BCG for intravesical use, is an attenuated, live culture preparation of the Bacillus of Calmette \nand Guerin (BCG) strain of Mycobacterium bovis.1 The TICE® strain was developed at the University of \nIllinois from a strain originated at the Pasteur Institute. \nThe medium in which the BCG organism is grown for preparation of the freeze-dried cake is composed \nof the following ingredients: glycerin, asparagine, citric acid, potassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, \nand iron ammonium citrate. The final preparation prior to freeze drying also contains lactose. The \nfreeze-dried BCG preparation is delivered in glass vials, each containing 1 to 8 x 108 colony forming \nunits (CFU) of TICE® BCG which is equivalent to approximately 50 mg wet weight. Determination of in-\nvitro potency is achieved through colony counts derived from a serial dilution assay. A single dose \nconsists of 1 reconstituted vial (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). \nFor intravesical use the entire vial is reconstituted with sterile saline. TICE® BCG is viable upon \nreconstitution. \nNo preservatives have been added. \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \nTICE® BCG induces a granulomatous reaction at the local site of administration. Intravesical TICE® \nBCG has been used as a therapy for, and prophylaxis against, recurrent tumors in patients with \ncarcinoma in situ (CIS) of the urinary bladder, and to prevent recurrence of Stage TaT1 papillary tumors \nof the bladder at high risk of recurrence. The precise mechanism of action is unknown. \nCLINICAL STUDIES \nTo evaluate the efficacy of intravesical administration of TICE® BCG in the treatment of carcinoma in \nsitu, patients were identified who had been treated with TICE® BCG under six different Investigational \nNew Drug (IND) applications in which the most important shared aspect was the use of an induction \nplus maintenance schedule. Patients received TICE® BCG (50 mg; 1 to 8 x 108 CFU) intravesically, \nonce weekly for at least 6 weeks and once monthly thereafter for up to 12 months. A longer \nmaintenance was given in some cases. The study population consisted of 153 patients, 132 males, 19 \nfemales, and 2 unidentified as to gender. Thirty patients lacking baseline documentation of CIS and \nfour patients lost to follow-up were not evaluable for treatment response. Therefore, 119 patients were \navailable for efficacy evaluation. The mean age was 69 years (range: 38–97 years). There were two \ncategories of clinical response: (1) Complete Histological Response (CR), defined as complete \nresolution of carcinoma in situ documented by cystoscopy and cytology, with or without biopsy; and (2) \nComplete Clinical Response Without Cytology (CRNC), defined as an apparent complete \ndisappearance of tumor upon cystoscopy. The results of a 1987 analysis of the evaluable patients are \nshown in Table I. \nTABLE I: THE RESPONSE OF PATIENTS WITH CIS BLADDER CANCER IN SIX IND STUDIES \n \nEntered \nEvaluable \nCR \nCRNC \nOverall Response \nNo. (%)Of Patients \n153 \n119 (78%) \n54 (46%) \n36 (30%) \n90 (76%) \nA 1989 update of these data is presented in Table II. The median duration of follow-up was 47 months. \nTABLE II: FOLLOW-UP RESPONSE OF PATIENTS WITH CIS BLADDER CANCER \nIN SIX IND STUDIES \n \n1989 Status of 90 Responders (CR or CRNC) \n \n1987/CR \n1987/CRNC \n1987 Response \n \nResponse \nn = 54 \nn = 36 \nn = 90 \nPercent \n \nCR \n \nCRNC \n \nUnrelated Deaths \n \nFailure \n30 \n0 \n6 \n18 \n15 \n0 \n6 \n15 \n45 \n0 \n12 \n33 \n50 \n0 \n13 \n37 \n \nThere was no significant difference in response rates between patients with or without prior intravesical \nchemotherapy. The median duration of response, calculated from the Kaplan-Meier curve as median \ntime to recurrence, is estimated at 4 years or greater. The incidence of cystectomy for 90 patients who \nachieved a complete response (CR or CRNC) was 11%. The median time to cystectomy in patients \nwho achieved a complete response (CR or CRNC) exceeded 74 months. \nThe efficacy of intravesical TICE® BCG in preventing the recurrence of a TaT1 bladder cancer after \ncomplete transurethral resection of all papillary tumors was evaluated in two open-label randomized \nphase III clinical trials. Initial diagnosis of patients included in the studies was determined by \ncystoscopic biopsies. One was conducted by the Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) in patients at \nhigh risk of recurrence. High risk was defined as two occurrences of tumor within 56 weeks, any stage \nT1 tumor, or three or more tumors presenting simultaneously. The second study was conducted at the \nNijmegen University Hospital; Nijmegen, The Netherlands. In this study patients were not selected for \nhigh risk of recurrence. In both studies treatment was initiated between 1 and 2 weeks after TUR. \nIn the SWOG trial (study 8795) patients were randomized to TICE® BCG or mitomycin C (MMC). Both \ndrugs were given intravesically weekly for 6 weeks, at 8 and 12 weeks, and then monthly for a total \ntreatment duration of 1 year. Cystoscopy and urinary cytology were performed every 3 months for 2 \nyears. Patients with progressive disease or residual or recurrent disease at or after the 6 month follow-\nup were removed from the study and were classified as treatment failures. \nA total of 469 patients was entered into the study: 237 to the TICE® BCG arm and 232 to the MMC arm. \nTwenty-two patients were subsequently found to be ineligible, and 66 patients had concurrent CIS, and \nwere analyzed separately. Four patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 191 evaluable patients in the \nTICE® BCG arm and 186 in the MMC arm. Of the patients, 84% were male and 16% were female. The \naverage age of these patients was 65 years old. \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimates of 2 year disease-free survival are shown in Table III. The difference in \ndisease-free survival time between the two groups was statistically significant by the log rank test \n(p=0.03). The 95% confidence interval of the difference in 2 year disease-free survival was 12% ± 10%. \nNo statistically significant differences between the groups were noted in time to tumor progression, \ntumor invasion, or overall survival. \n \nTABLE III: RESULTS OF SWOG STUDY 8795 \n \nTICE® BCG Arm \nMMC Arm \n \n \nN = 191 \nN = 186 \n \nEstimated Disease-Free Survival at 2 years \n57% \n45% \n \n95% Confidence Interval (CI) \n(50%, 65%) \n(38%, 53%) \nIn the Nijmegen study, the efficacy of three treatments was compared: TICE substrain BCG, \nRijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieuhygiene substrain BCG (BCG-RIVM), and MMC. \nTICE® BCG and BCG-RIVM were given intravesically weekly for 6 weeks. In contrast to the SWOG \nstudy, maintenance BCG was not given. Mitomycin C was given intravesically weekly for 4 weeks and \nthen monthly for a total duration of treatment of 6 months. Cystoscopy and urinary cytology were \nperformed every 3 months until recurrence. \nA total of 469 patients was enrolled and randomized. Thirty-two patients were not evaluable, 17 were \nineligible, 15 were withdrawn before treatment, and 50 had concurrent CIS and were analyzed \nseparately, leaving 387 evaluable patients: 117 in the TICE® BCG arm, 134 in the BCG-RIVM arm, and \n136 in the MMC arm. Twenty-eight patients (24%) in the TICE® BCG arm, 32 patients (24%) in the \nBCG-RIVM arm and 24 patients (18%) in the MMC arm had TaG1 tumors. The median duration of \nfollow-up was 22 months (range 3–54 months). \nThe Kaplan-Meier estimates of 2 year disease-free survival are shown in Table IV. The differences in \ndisease-free survival among the three arms were not statistically significant by the log-rank test \n(p=0.08). \n \nTABLE IV: RESULTS OF NIJMEGEN STUDY \n \nTICE® BCG Arm \nBCG-RIVM Arm \nMMC Arm \n \n \nN = 117 \nN = 134 \nN = 136 \n \nEstimated Disease-Free Survival at 2 years \n \n95% Confidence Interval (CI) \n53% \n(44%, 64%) \n62% \n(53%, 72%) \n64% \n(55%, 74%) \nIn both the SWOG 8795 study and the Nijmegen study, acute toxicity was more common, and usually \nmore severe, with TICE® BCG than with MMC (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). \nINDICATIONS AND USAGE \nTICE® BCG is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the urinary \nbladder, and for the prophylaxis of primary or recurrent stage Ta and/or T1 papillary tumors following \ntransurethral resection (TUR). TICE® BCG is not recommended for stage TaG1 papillary tumors, unless \nthey are judged to be at high risk of tumor recurrence. \nTICE® BCG is not indicated for papillary tumors of stages higher than T1. \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \nTICE® BCG should not be used in immunosuppressed patients or persons with congenital or acquired \nimmune deficiencies, whether due to concurrent disease (e.g., AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma) cancer \ntherapy (e.g., cytotoxic drugs, radiation) or immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., corticosteroids). \nTreatment should be postponed until resolution of a concurrent febrile illness, urinary tract infection, or \ngross hematuria. Seven to 14 days should elapse before BCG is administered following biopsy, TUR, \nor traumatic catheterization. \nTICE® BCG should not be administered to persons with active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis should \nbe ruled out in individuals who are PPD positive before starting treatment with TICE® BCG. \nWARNINGS \nBCG LIVE (TICE® BCG) is not a vaccine for the prevention of cancer. BCG Vaccine, U.S.P., not \nBCG LIVE (TICE® BCG), should be used for the prevention of tuberculosis. For vaccination use, refer \nto BCG Vaccine, U.S.P. prescribing information. \nTICE® BCG is an infectious agent. Physicians using this product should be familiar with the literature on \nthe prevention and treatment of BCG-related complications, and should be prepared in such \nemergencies to contact an infectious disease specialist with experience in treating the infectious \ncomplications of intravesical BCG. The treatment of the infectious complications of BCG requires long-\nterm, multiple-drug antibiotic therapy. Special culture media are required for mycobacteria, and \nphysicians administering intravesical BCG or those caring for these patients should have these media \nreadily available. \nInstillation of TICE® BCG with an actively bleeding mucosa may promote systemic BCG infection. \nTreatment should be postponed for at least one week following transurethral resection, biopsy, \ntraumatic catheterization, or gross hematuria. \nDeaths have been reported as a result of systemic BCG infection and sepsis.2,3 Patients should be \nmonitored for the presence of symptoms and signs of toxicity after each intravesical treatment. Febrile \nepisodes with flu-like symptoms lasting more than 72 hours, fever ≥103°F, systemic manifestations \nincreasing in intensity with repeated instillations, or persistent abnormalities of liver function tests \nsuggest systemic BCG infection and may require antituberculous therapy. Local symptoms (prostatitis, \nepididymitis, orchitis) lasting more than 2–3 days may also suggest active infection (see Management \nof Serious BCG Complications subsection of WARNINGS). \nThe use of TICE® BCG may cause tuberculin sensitivity. Since this is a valuable aid in the diagnosis of \ntuberculosis, it is advisable to determine the tuberculin reactivity by PPD skin testing before treatment. \nIntravesical instillations of BCG should be postponed during treatment with antibiotics, since \nantimicrobial therapy may interfere with the effectiveness of TICE® BCG (see PRECAUTIONS). TICE® \nBCG should not be used in individuals with concurrent infections. \nSmall bladder capacity has been associated with increased risk of severe local reactions and should be \nconsidered in deciding to use TICE® BCG therapy. \nManagement of Serious BCG Complications. \nAcute, localized irritative toxicities of TICE® BCG may be accompanied by systemic manifestations, \nconsistent with a “flu-like” syndrome. Systemic adverse effects of 1–2 days’ duration such as malaise, \nfever, and chills often reflect hypersensitivity reactions. However, symptoms such as fever of ≥38.5°C \n(101.3°F), or acute localized inflammation such as epididymitis, prostatitis, or orchitis persisting \nlonger than 2–3 days suggest active infection, and evaluation for serious infectious \ncomplication should be considered. \nIn patients who develop persistent fever or experience an acute febrile illness consistent with BCG \ninfection, two or more antimycobacterial agents should be administered while diagnostic evaluation, \nincluding cultures, is conducted. BCG treatment should be discontinued. Negative cultures do not \nnecessarily rule out infection. Physicians using this product should be familiar with the literature on \nprevention, diagnosis, and treatment of BCG-related complications and, when appropriate, should \nconsult an infectious disease specialist or other physician with experience in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of mycobacterial infections. \nTICE® BCG is sensitive to the most commonly used antituberculous agents (isoniazid, rifampin and \nethambutol). TICE® BCG is not sensitive to pyrazinamide. \nPRECAUTIONS \nGeneral \nTICE® BCG contains live mycobacteria and should be prepared and handled using aseptic technique \n(see Preparation of Agent subsection of DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). BCG infections have \nbeen reported in health care workers preparing BCG for administration. Needle stick injuries should be \navoided during the handling and mixing of TICE® BCG. Nosocomial infections have been reported in \npatients receiving parenteral drugs which were prepared in areas in which BCG was prepared.4 \nBCG is capable of dissemination when administered by intravesical route and serious reactions, \nincluding fatal infections, have been reported in patients receiving intravesical BCG.3 Care should be \ntaken not to traumatize the urinary tract or to introduce contaminants into the urinary system. Seven to \n14 days should elapse before TICE® BCG is administered following TUR, biopsy, or traumatic \ncatheterization. \nTICE® BCG should be administered with caution to persons in groups at high risk for HIV infection. \nLaboratory Tests \nThe use of TICE® BCG may cause tuberculin sensitivity. It is advisable to determine the tuberculin \nreactivity of patients receiving TICE® BCG by PPD skin testing before treatment is initiated. \nInformation for Patients \nTICE® BCG is retained in the bladder for 2 hours and then voided. Patients should void while seated in \norder to avoid splashing of urine. For the 6 hours after treatment, urine voided should be disinfected for \n15 minutes with an equal volume of household bleach before flushing. Patients should be instructed to \nincrease fluid intake in order to “flush” the bladder in the hours following BCG treatment. Patients may \nexperience burning with the first void after treatment. \nPatients should be attentive to side effects, such as fever, chills, malaise, flu-like symptoms, or \nincreased fatigue. If the patient experiences severe urinary side effects, such as burning or pain on \nurination, urgency, frequency of urination, blood in urine, or other symptoms such as joint pain, cough, \nor skin rash, the physician should be notified. \nDrug Interaction \nDrug combinations containing immunosuppressants and/or bone marrow depressants and/or radiation \ninterfere with the development of the immune response and should not be used in combination with \nTICE® BCG. Antimicrobial therapy for other infections may interfere with the effectiveness of TICE® \nBCG. There are no data to suggest that the acute, local urinary tract toxicity common with BCG is due \nto mycobacterial infection and antituberculosis drugs (e.g., isoniazid) should not be used to \nprevent or treat the local, irritative toxicities of TICE® BCG. \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nTICE® BCG has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic, mutagenic potentials or impairment of fertility. \nPregnancy \nTeratogenic Effects – Pregnancy Category C \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with TICE® BCG. It is also not known whether \nTICE® BCG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive \ncapacity. TICE® BCG should not be given to a pregnant woman except when clearly needed. Women \nshould be advised not to become pregnant while on therapy. \nNursing Mothers \nIt is not known whether TICE® BCG is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in \nhuman milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from TICE® BCG in nursing \ninfants, it is advisable to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the \nimportance of the drug to the mother. \nPediatric Use \nSafety and effectiveness of TICE® BCG for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer in pediatric \npatients have not been established. \nGeriatric Use \nOf the total number of subjects in clinical studies of TICE® BCG, the average age was 66 years old. No \noverall difference in safety or effectiveness was observed between older and younger subjects. Other \nreported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between elderly and younger \npatients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to BCG cannot be ruled out. \nADVERSE REACTIONS \nSymptoms of bladder irritability, related to the inflammatory response induced, are reported in \napproximately 60% of patients receiving TICE® BCG. The symptoms typically begin 4–6 hours after \ninstillation and last 24–72 hours. The irritative side effects are usually seen following the third \ninstillation, and tend to increase in severity after each administration. \nThe irritative bladder adverse effects can usually be managed symptomatically with products such as \npyridium, propantheline bromide, oxybutynin chloride and acetaminophen. The mechanism of action of \nthe irritative side effects has not been firmly established, but is most consistent with an immunological \nmechanism.3 There is no evidence that dose reduction or antituberculous drug therapy can prevent or \nlessen the irritative toxicity of TICE® BCG. \n“Flu-like” symptoms (malaise, fever, and chills) which may accompany the localized, irritative toxicities \noften reflect hypersensitivity reactions which can be treated symptomatically. Antihistamines have also \nbeen used.5 \nAdverse reactions to TICE® BCG tend to be progressive in frequency and severity with subsequent \ninstillation. Delay or postponement of subsequent treatment may or may not reduce the severity of a \nreaction during subsequent instillation. \nAlthough uncommon, serious infectious complications of intravesical BCG have been reported.2,3,6 The \nmost serious infectious complication of BCG is disseminated sepsis with associated mortality. In \naddition, M. bovis infections have been reported in lung, liver, bone, bone marrow, kidney, regional \nlymph nodes, and prostate in patients who have received intravesical BCG. Some male genitourinary \ntract infections (orchitis/epididymitis) have been resistant to multiple drug antituberculous therapy and \nrequired orchiectomy. \nIf a patient develops persistent fever or experiences an acute febrile illness consistent with BCG \ninfection, BCG treatment should be discontinued and the patient immediately evaluated and \ntreated for systemic infection (see WARNINGS). \nThe local and systemic adverse reactions reported in a review of 674 patients with superficial bladder \ncancer, including 153 patients with carcinoma in situ, are summarized in Table V. \nTABLE V: SUMMARY OF ADVERSE EFFECTS SEEN IN 674 PATIENTS WITH \nSUPERFICIAL BLADDER CANCER, INCLUDING 153 WITH CARCINOMA IN SITU \n \nPercent of Patients \nPercent of Patients \n \nAdverse \n \nOverall \nAdverse \n \nOverall \n \nEvent \nN \n(Grade ≥3) \nEvent \nN \n(Grade ≥3) \nDysuria \nUrinary Frequency \nFlu-Like Syndrome \nHematuria \nFever \nMalaise/Fatigue \nCystitis \nUrgency \nNocturia \nCramps/Pain \nRigors \nNausea/Vomiting \n401 \n272 \n224 \n175 \n134 \n 50 \n 40 \n 39 \n 30 \n 27 \n22 \n 20 \n60% (11%) \n40% (7%) \n33% (9%) \n26% (7%) \n20% (8%) \n7% (0) \n6% (2%) \n6% (1%) \n5% (1%) \n4% (1%) \n3% (1%) \n3% (<1%) \nArthritis/Myalgia \nHeadache/Dizziness \nUrinary Incontinence \nAnorexia/Weight Loss \nUrinary Debris \nAllergy \nCardiac (Unclassified) \nGenital Inflammation/ \n   Abscess \nRespiratory (Unclassified) \nUrinary Tract Infection \nAbdominal Pain \n18 \n16 \n16 \n15 \n15 \n14 \n13 \n12 \n11 \n10 \n10 \n3% (<1%) \n2% (0) \n2% (0) \n2% (<1%) \n2% (<1%) \n2% (<1%) \n2% (1%) \n2% (<1%) \n2% (<1%) \n2% (1%) \n2% (1%) \nThe following adverse events were reported in ≤1% of patients: anemia, BCG sepsis, coagulopathy, \ncontracted bladder, diarrhea, epididymitis/prostatitis, hepatic granuloma, hepatitis, leukopenia, \n \nneurologic (unclassified), orchitis, pneumonitis, pyuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, urethritis, and urinary \nobstruction. \nIn SWOG study 8795, toxicity evaluations were available on a total of 222 TICE® BCG-treated patients \nand 220 MMC-treated patients. Direct bladder toxicity (cramps, dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria, \nhemorrhagic cystitis, or incontinence) was seen more often with TICE® BCG, with 356 events \ncompared to 234 events for MMC. Grade ≤2 toxicity was seen significantly more frequently following \nTICE® BCG treatment (p=0.003). No life-threatening toxicity was seen in either arm. Systemic toxicity \nwith TICE® BCG was markedly increased compared to that of MMC, with 181 events for TICE® BCG \ncompared to 80 for MMC. The frequency of toxicity was increased in all grades, particularly for grades 2 \nand 3. The most common complaints were malaise, fatigue and lethargy, fever, and abdominal pain. \nThirty-two TICE® BCG patients were reported to have been treated with isoniazid. Five TICE® BCG \npatients had liver enzyme elevation, including two with grade 3 elevations. Eighteen of the 222 (8.1%) \nTICE® BCG patients failed to complete the prescribed protocol compared to 6.2% in the MMC group. \nTable VI summarizes the most common adverse reactions reported in this trial.7 \nTABLE VI: MOST COMMON ADVERSE REACTIONS IN SWOG STUDY 8795* \n \nStudy Arm\n \nTICE® BCG (N = 222) \nMMC (N = 220) \nAdverse Event \nAll Grades \nGrade ≥3 \nAll Grades \nGrade ≥3 \nDysuria \nUrgency/Frequency \nHematuria \nFlu-Like Symptoms \nFever \nPain (Not Specified) \nHemorrhagic Cystitis \nChills \nBladder Cramps \nNausea \nIncontinence \nMyalgia/Arthralgia \nDiaphoresis \nRash \n115 (52%) \n112 (50%) \n85 (38%) \n54 (24%) \n37 (17%) \n37 (17%) \n19 (9%) \n19 (9%) \n18 (8%) \n16 (7%) \n8 (4%) \n7 (3%) \n7 (3%) \n6 (3%) \n6 (3%) \n5 (2%) \n6 (3%) \n1 (<1%) \n1 (<1%) \n4 (2%) \n3 (1%) \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n1 (<1%) \n77 (35%) \n63 (29%) \n56 (25%) \n29 (13%) \n7 (3%) \n22 (10%) \n10 (5%) \n2 (1%) \n9 (4%) \n12 (5%) \n3 (1%) \n0 \n1 (<1%) \n16 (7%) \n5 (2%) \n7 (3%) \n5 (2%) \n0 \n0 \n1 (<1%) \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0\n0 \n2 (1%) \n*The adverse reaction profile of TICE® BCG was similar in the Nijmegen study.8 \n \n \n \nOVERDOSAGE \nOverdosage occurs if more than one vial of TICE® BCG is administered per instillation. If overdosage \noccurs, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of active local or systemic BCG infection. For \nacute local or systemic reactions suggesting active infection, an infectious disease specialist \nexperienced in BCG complications should be consulted. \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \nThe dose for the intravesical treatment of carcinoma in situ and for the prophylaxis of recurrent papillary \ntumors consists of one vial of TICE® BCG suspended in 50 ml preservative-free saline. \nDo not inject subcutaneously or intravenously. \nPreparation of Agent \nThe preparation of the TICE® BCG suspension should be done using aseptic technique. To avoid \ncross-contamination, parenteral drugs should not be prepared in areas where BCG has been prepared. \nA separate area for the preparation of the TICE® BCG suspension is recommended. All equipment, \nsupplies and receptacles in contact with TICE® BCG should be handled and disposed of as \nbiohazardous. The pharmacist or individual responsible for mixing the agent should wear gloves and \ntake precautions to avoid contact of BCG with broken skin. If preparation cannot be performed in a \nbiocontainment hood, then a mask and gown should be worn to avoid inhalation of BCG organisms and \ninadvertent exposure to broken skin. \nOption-1 (Using Syringe Method) \nDraw 1 ml of sterile, preservative-free saline (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection U.S.P.) at 4–\n25°C, into a small syringe (e.g., 3 ml) and add to one vial of TICE® BCG to resuspend. \nGently swirl the vial until a homogenous suspension is obtained. Avoid forceful agitation \nwhich may cause clumping of the mycobacteria. Dispense the cloudy TICE® BCG \nsuspension into the top end of a catheter-tip syringe which contains 49 ml of saline diluent, \nbringing the total volume to 50 ml. To mix, gently rotate the syringe.  \nOption-2 (Using Reconstitution Accessories) \nReconstitution Accessories may be provided with each TICE® BCG product order. Please \nrefer to the Instructions For Use provided with the accessories for a full description of the \nproduct reconstitution procedures using these accessories. \nThe reconstituted TICE® BCG should be kept refrigerated (2–8°C), protected from exposure to direct \nsunlight, and used within 2 hours. Unused solution should be discarded after 2 hours. \nNote: DO NOT filter the contents of the TICE® BCG vial. Precautions should be taken to avoid \nexposing the TICE® BCG to direct sunlight. Bacteriostatic solutions must be avoided. In addition, use \nonly sterile preservative-free saline, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection U.S.P. as diluent. \nTreatment and Schedule \nAllow 7–14 days to elapse after bladder biopsy before TICE® BCG is administered. Patients should not \ndrink fluids for 4 hours before treatment and should empty their bladder prior to TICE® BCG \nadministration. The reconstituted TICE® BCG is instilled into the bladder by gravity flow via the catheter. \nDO NOT depress plunger and force the flow of the TICE® BCG. The TICE® BCG is retained in the \nbladder 2 hours and then voided. Patients unable to retain the suspension for 2 hours should be \nallowed to void sooner, if necessary. \nWhile the BCG is retained in the bladder, the patient ideally should be repositioned from left side to \nright side and also should lie upon the back and the abdomen, changing these positions every 15 \nminutes to maximize bladder surface exposure to the agent. \nA standard treatment schedule consists of one intravesical instillation per week for 6 weeks. This \nschedule may be repeated once if tumor remission has not been achieved and if the clinical \ncircumstances warrant. Thereafter, intravesical TICE® BCG administration should continue at \napproximately monthly intervals for at least 6–12 months. There are no data to support the \ninterchangeability of BCG LIVE products. \nHOW SUPPLIED \nTICE® BCG is supplied in a box of one vial of TICE® BCG. Each vial contains 1 to 8 x 108 CFU, which is \nequivalent to approximately 50 mg (wet weight), as lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder. \nNDC 0052-0602-02. \nSTORAGE \nThe intact vials of TICE® BCG should be stored refrigerated, at 2–8°C (36–46°F). \nThis agent contains live bacteria and should be protected from direct sunlight. The product should not \nbe used after the expiration date printed on the label. \nRx Only \nREFERENCES \n1. DeJager R, Guinan P, Lamm D, Khanna O, Brosman S, DeKernion J, et al.

After shaking, \nthe vaccine appears as a homogeneous milky white suspension.  \n \nEach 0.5 mL dose of MassBiologics’ TDVAX is formulated to contain the following active ingredients: 2 \nLf of tetanus toxoid and 2 Lf of diphtheria toxoid.  Each 0.5 mL dose also contains aluminum adjuvant (not \nmore than 0.53 mg aluminum by assay), < 100 mcg (0.02%) of residual formaldehyde, and a trace amount \nof thimerosal [mercury derivative, (< 0.3 mcg mercury/dose)] (not as a preservative) from the \nmanufacturing process.   \n \nThe Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Clostridium tetani organisms are grown on modified Mueller's \nmedia1, 2 which contains bovine extracts.  The bovine material used in these extracts is sourced from \ncountries which the United States Department of Agriculture has determined neither have nor present an \nundue risk for bovine spongiform encephalopathy.  Tetanus and diphtheria toxins produced during growth \nof the cultures are detoxified with formaldehyde.  The detoxified materials are then separately purified by \nammonium sulfate fractionation. The diphtheria toxoid is further purified by column chromatography.  The \ntetanus and diphtheria toxoids are individually adsorbed onto aluminum phosphate.   \n \nThe tetanus and diphtheria toxoids induce at least 2 units and 1 unit of antitoxin per mL of serum, \nrespectively, in the guinea pig potency test.   \n \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY   \nTETANUS  \nTetanus (also known as lockjaw) is a serious, often fatal disease caused by an extremely potent neurotoxin \nproduced by C. tetani. \n \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to tetanus toxin.  A serum \ntetanus antitoxin level of 0.01 IU/mL measured via a neutralization assay is considered the minimum \nprotective level.3, 4  The efficacy against tetanus of MassBiologics’ TDVAX is supported by the following: \n \n1.  Response to primary series.  Of 20 adults with less than 0.0025 units/mL of tetanus antitoxin in pre-\nimmunization serum, 14 (70%) had antitoxin concentrations of 0.01 or greater after 2 doses of TDVAX \n(2 Lf tetanus toxoid dose).  After 3 doses of TDVAX, 16 of 16 adults achieved 0.01 antitoxin units/mL. \n \n2.  Response to booster doses.  Booster doses of TDVAX at doses of 1 Lf and 5 Lf of tetanus toxoid \ninduced tetanus antitoxin levels greater than 0.01 units/mL when administered to all 36 adults who had \nreceived prior tetanus immunizations.5 \n \nDIPHTHERIA  \nDiphtheria is an acute toxin-mediated disease caused by toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae.  Protection \nagainst disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to diphtheria toxin.  A serum diphtheria \nantitoxin level of 0.01 IU/mL is the lowest level giving some degree of protection.3, 6  The efficacy against \ndiphtheria of MassBiologics’ TDVAX is supported by the following: \n \n1.  Response to primary series.  Of 10 adults with less than 0.001 units/mL of diphtheria antitoxin in pre-\nimmunization serum, 50% had antitoxin concentrations of 0.01 or greater after 2 doses of TDVAX (2 Lf \ndiphtheria toxoid dose).  After 3 doses of TDVAX, 6 of 6 adults achieved 0.01 antitoxin units/mL. \n \n2.  Response to booster doses.  In clinical trials, booster doses of TDVAX formulated to contain 1 Lf and 5 \nLf of diphtheria toxoid, both induced antitoxin levels greater than 0.01 units/mL when administered to \nadults with prior diphtheria immunity. 5, 7, 8   In 140 adolescent males given a single booster dose of the 1 \nLf formulation, all achieved an antitoxin titer of 0.01 units/mL or higher.8 \n \nINDICATIONS AND USAGE  \nMassBiologics’ TDVAX is a vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of tetanus and \ndiphtheria.  This vaccine is approved for use in persons 7 years of age and older.   \n \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \nA severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) occurring after a previous dose of this vaccine, or any other \ntetanus or diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine, or any component of this vaccine is a contraindication to \nadministration of MassBiologics’ TDVAX vaccine.  (See DESCRIPTION).  Because of the uncertainty as \nto which component of the vaccine might be responsible, no further vaccination with diphtheria or tetanus \ncomponents should be carried out.  Alternatively, such individuals may be referred to an allergist for \nevaluation if further immunizations are to be considered. \n \n \n \n \nWARNINGS \nFREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION \nMore frequent administration of MassBiologics’ TDVAX than described in DOSAGE AND \nADMINISTRATION may be associated with an increased incidence and severity of adverse reactions. \n \nARTHUS REACTIONS \nPersons who experienced an Arthus-type hypersensitivity reaction following a prior dose of a tetanus \ntoxoid-containing vaccine usually have high serum tetanus antitoxin levels and should not receive \nMassBiologics’ TDVAX more frequently than every 10 years, even for tetanus prophylaxis as part of \nwound management. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). \n \nGUILLAIN-BARRÉ SYNDROME \nA review by the Institute of Medicine found evidence for a causal relation between tetanus toxoid and \nGuillain-Barré Syndrome.9  If Guillain-Barré Syndrome occurred within 6 weeks after receipt of a previous \ndose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, the decision to give subsequent doses of MassBiologics’ \nTDVAX or any vaccine containing tetanus toxoid should be based on careful consideration of the potential \nbenefits and possible risks. 10 \n \nVaccination with MassBiologics’ TDVAX may not protect all individuals. \n \nPRECAUTIONS \nGENERAL \nEpinephrine injection (1:1000) and other appropriate agents and equipment must be immediately available \nshould an acute anaphylactic reaction occur. \n \nPrior to the administration of MassBiologics’ TDVAX, the vaccine recipient’s current health status and \nhealth history should be reviewed.  This includes a review of the immunization history of the patient, the \npresence of any contraindications to immunization, and any adverse events after previous immunizations to \nallow an assessment of the benefits and risks of vaccination.  (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and \nWARNINGS). \n \nIf MassBiologics’ TDVAX is administered to immunocompromised persons (whether from disease or \ntreatment) the expected immune response may not be obtained. \n \nINFORMATION FOR PATIENTS \nPrior to administration of MassBiologics’ TDVAX, patients, parents or guardians should be informed by \nthe health care provider of the benefits and risks of immunization with TDVAX and of the importance of \ncompleting the primary immunization series or receiving recommended booster doses. \n \nThe health care provider should inform the patient, parent, or guardian of the potential for adverse reactions \nthat have been temporally associated with MassBiologics’ TDVAX or other vaccines containing similar \ningredients.  Patients, parents or guardians should be instructed to report any suspected adverse reactions to \ntheir health care provider. \n \nAccording to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Vaccine Information Statements must be \nprovided by the health care provider with each vaccine dose administered.10 \n \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \nPatients who are on immunosuppressive therapy, including alkylating agents, antimetabolites, cytotoxic \ndrugs, irradiation, or corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may have a reduced immune \nresponse to vaccines. \n \nNo safety and immunogenicity data are available on the concomitant administration of MassBiologics’ \nTDVAX vaccine with other U.S. licensed vaccines. \n \nCARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY \nNo studies have been performed with MassBiologics’ TDVAX to evaluate carcinogenicity, mutagenic \npotential, or impairment of fertility. \n \nPREGNANCY \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with MassBiologics’ TDVAX.  It is also not known \nwhether MassBiologics’ TDVAX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can \naffect reproduction capacity.  MassBiologics’ TDVAX should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly \nneeded. \n \nNURSING MOTHERS  \nIt is not known whether MassBiologics’ TDVAX is excreted in human milk.  Because many drugs are \nexcreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when MassBiologics’ TDVAX is administered to a \nnursing woman. \n \nPEDIATRIC USE  \nMassBiologics’ TDVAX is not approved for use in infants and children younger than 7 years of age.  The \nsafety and effectiveness of MassBiologics’ TDVAX in this age group have not been established. \n \nGERIATRIC USE \nNo studies have been performed with MassBiologics’ TDVAX in adults aged 65 years and older in order to \ndetermine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. \n \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \nDATA FROM CLINICAL TRIALS \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in \nthe clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine, \nand may not reflect the rates observed in practice.  However, the adverse reaction information from clinical \ntrials provides a basis for identifying adverse events that appear to be related to vaccine use and for \napproximating rates.  Data on adverse reactions following fluid and adsorbed preparations of \nMassBiologics’ TDVAX with various doses of the diphtheria and tetanus components have been reported \nin a series of studies.5, 7, 8, 11, 12  \n \nPOSTMARKETING REPORTS \nThe following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of MassBiologics’ TDVAX.  \nBecause these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always \npossible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to vaccination.  The \nfollowing adverse events were included because of seriousness or frequency of reporting: \nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Injection site reactions, including pain, tenderness, \nerythema, induration, pruritis, swelling and warmth; peripheral oedema, pyrexia, malaise \nNervous System Disorders:  Dizziness, headache, convulsions \nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia, musculoskeletal stiffness or pain, arthralgia \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Rash \nGastrointestinal Disorders: Nausea \nInfections and Infestations: Cellulitis \n \nREPORTING OF SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact MassBiologics at 1-800-457-4626 or \nVAERS at 1-800-822-7967 or www.vaers.hhs.gov. \n \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \nPRIMARY IMMUNIZATION   \nMassBiologics’ TDVAX may be used in persons 7 years of age and older who have not been previously \nimmunized against tetanus and diphtheria, as a primary immunization series consisting of three 0.5 mL \ndoses.  The first two doses are administered 4-8 weeks apart and the third dose is administered 6-12 months \nafter the second dose. \n \nMassBiologics’ TDVAX may be used to complete the primary immunization series for tetanus and \ndiphtheria, following one or two doses of Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed \n(whole-cell DTP), Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (DTaP) \nand/or Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids Adsorbed (DT) vaccine.  However, the safety and efficacy of \nMassBiologics’ TDVAX in such regimens have not been evaluated. \n \nROUTINE BOOSTER IMMUNIZATION \nMassBiologics’ TDVAX may be used for routine booster immunization against tetanus and diphtheria in \npersons 7 years of age and older who have completed primary immunization against tetanus and diphtheria.  \nRoutine booster immunization against tetanus and diphtheria is recommended in children 11-12 years of \nage and every 10 years thereafter.10 \n \nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has specific recommendations on booster \nimmunization against tetanus and diphtheria for adolescents and adults.10, 13, 14 \n \nTETANUS PROPHYLAXIS IN WOUND MANAGEMENT   \nFor active tetanus immunization in wound management of patients 7 years of age and older, a preparation \ncontaining tetanus and diphtheria toxoids is preferred instead of single-antigen tetanus toxoid to enhance \ndiphtheria protection.15   MassBiologics’ TDVAX is approved for wound management of patients 7 years \nof age and older. \n \nThe need for active immunization with a tetanus toxoid-containing preparation, with or without Tetanus \nImmune Globulin (TIG) (Human) depends on both the condition of the wound and the patient’s vaccination \nhistory (Table 1). \n \nWhen indicated, TIG (Human) should be administered using a separate needle and syringe at a different \nanatomic site, according to the manufacturer’s package insert.  If a contraindication to using a tetanus \ntoxoid-containing vaccine exists in a person who has not completed tetanus primary immunization and \nother than a clean, minor wound is sustained, only passive immunization with TIG (Human) should be \ngiven.15 \n \n \n \nTABLE 1  GUIDE TO TETANUS PROPHYLAXIS IN ROUTINE WOUND MANAGEMENT IN PERSONS AGED 7 YEARS \nAND OLDER13, 14, 15 \nHistory of Adsorbed Tetanus \nToxoid (Doses) \nClean, Minor Wounds \nAll Other Wounds* \nTd† \nTIG \nTd† \nTIG \nUnknown or < 3 \nYes \nNo \nYes \nYes \n> 3 ‡ \nNo§ \nNo \nNo¶ \nNo \n* Such as, but not limited to, wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, soil, and saliva; puncture wounds; \navulsions; and wounds resulting from missiles, crushing, burns and frostbite. \n† The ACIP has specific recommendations on use of Td or Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoids \nand Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap) in adolescents and adults.13, 14  \n‡  If only three doses of fluid tetanus toxoid have been received, then a fourth dose of toxoid, preferably an \nadsorbed toxoid, should be given. \n§ Yes, if > 10 years since the last tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine dose. \n¶ Yes, if > 5 years since the last tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine dose.  (More frequent boosters are not \nneeded and can accentuate side effects.)  \n \nDIPHTHERIA PROPHYLAXIS FOR CASE CONTACTS \nMassBiologics’ TDVAX may be used for post-exposure diphtheria prophylaxis in persons 7 years of age \nand older who have not completed primary vaccination, whose vaccination status is unknown, or who have \nnot been vaccinated with diphtheria toxoid within the previous 5 years.  Consult ACIP recommendations \nfor additional interventions for post-exposure diphtheria prophylaxis.15 \n \nADMINISTRATION \nShake the vial well to resuspend the vaccine before withdrawing the dose.  After shaking, MassBiologics’ \nTDVAX is a homogenous milky white suspension.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually \nfor particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.  If \nthese conditions exist, MassBiologics’ TDVAX should not be administered. \n \nInject 0.5 mL of MassBiologics’ TDVAX intramuscularly.  The preferred site is the deltoid muscle.  The \nvaccine should not be injected into the gluteal area or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk. \n \nDo not administer this vaccine intravenously, subcutaneously, or intradermally. \n \nMassBiologics’ TDVAX should not be combined through reconstitution or mixed with any other vaccine. \n \nHOW SUPPLIED \nThe stopper of the vial is not made with natural rubber latex. \nMassBiologics’ TDVAX is supplied in a package of 10 single dose vials. \nNDC No. 14362-0111-3 – Individual single dose (0.5 mL) vials. \nNDC No. 14362-0111-4 – Package containing ten vials. \n \nSTORAGE  \nStore at 2°C - 8°C (36°F - 46°F).

See full prescribing information \nfor GARDASIL.  \n \nGARDASIL® \n[Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) \nVaccine, Recombinant] \nSuspension for intramuscular injection  \nInitial U.S. Approval: 2006 \n ----------------------------INDICATIONS AND USAGE ---------------------------- \nGARDASIL is a vaccine indicated in girls and women 9 through 26 years \nof age for the prevention of the following diseases caused by Human \nPapillomavirus (HPV) types included in the vaccine: \n• \nCervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancer caused by HPV types 16 \nand 18. (1.1) \n• \nGenital warts (condyloma acuminata) caused by HPV types 6 and \n11. (1.1) \nAnd the following precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV \ntypes 6, 11, 16, and 18:  \n• \nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2/3 and Cervical \nadenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). (1.1) \n• \nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1. (1.1) \n• \nVulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) grade 2 and grade 3. (1.1) \n• \nVaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) grade 2 and grade 3. (1.1) \n• \nAnal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) grades 1, 2, and 3. (1.1) \n \nGARDASIL is indicated in boys and men 9 through 26 years of age for \nthe prevention of the following diseases caused by HPV types included \nin the vaccine: \n• \nAnal cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18. (1.2) \n• \nGenital warts (condyloma acuminata) caused by HPV types 6 and \n11. (1.2) \nAnd the following precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV \ntypes 6, 11, 16, and 18: \n• \nAnal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) grades 1, 2, and 3. (1.2) \n \nLimitations of GARDASIL Use and Effectiveness: \n• \nGARDASIL does not eliminate the necessity for women to continue \nto undergo recommended cervical cancer screening. (1.3, 17) \n• \nRecipients of GARDASIL should not discontinue anal cancer \nscreening if it has been recommended by a health care provider. \n(1.3, 17) \n• \nGARDASIL has not been demonstrated to provide protection \nagainst disease from vaccine and non-vaccine HPV types to which \na person has previously been exposed through sexual activity. (1.3, \n14.4, 14.5) \n• \nGARDASIL is not intended to be used for treatment of active \nexternal genital lesions; cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers; \nCIN; VIN; VaIN, or AIN. (1.3) \n• \nGARDASIL has not been demonstrated to protect against diseases \ndue to HPV types not contained in the vaccine. (1.3, 14.4, 14.5)  \n• \nNot all vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers are caused by HPV, and \nGARDASIL protects only against those vulvar, vaginal, and anal \ncancers caused by HPV 16 and 18. (1.3)  \n• \nGARDASIL does not protect against genital diseases not caused by \nHPV. (1.3) \n• \nVaccination with GARDASIL may not result in protection in all \nvaccine recipients. (1.3) \n• \nGARDASIL has not been demonstrated to prevent HPV-related CIN \n2/3 or worse in women older than 26 years of age. (14.7) \n ----------------------- DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ----------------------- \n0.5-mL suspension for intramuscular injection at the following schedule: \n0, 2 months, 6 months. (2.1) \n --------------------- DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS --------------------- \n• \n0.5-mL suspension for injection as a single-dose vial and prefilled \nsyringe. (3, 11) \n ------------------------------- CONTRAINDICATIONS ------------------------------- \n• \nHypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast (a \nvaccine component), or after a previous dose of GARDASIL. (4, 11) \n ----------------------- WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ----------------------- \n• \nBecause vaccinees may develop syncope, sometimes resulting in \nfalling with injury, observation for 15 minutes after administration is \nrecommended. Syncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic \nmovements and other seizure-like activity, has been reported \nfollowing vaccination with GARDASIL. When syncope is associated \nwith tonic-clonic movements, the activity is usually transient and \ntypically responds to restoring cerebral perfusion by maintaining a \nsupine or Trendelenburg position. (5.1) \n ------------------------------ ADVERSE REACTIONS ------------------------------ \nThe most common adverse reaction was headache. Common adverse \nreactions (frequency of at least 1.0% and greater than AAHS control or \nsaline placebo) are fever, nausea, dizziness; and injection-site pain, \nswelling, erythema, pruritus, and bruising.

Women \nwho receive GARDASIL should continue to undergo cervical cancer screening per standard of care. [See \nPatient Counseling Information (17).] \nRecipients of GARDASIL should not discontinue anal cancer screening if it has been recommended by \na health care provider. [See Patient Counseling Information (17).] \nGARDASIL has not been demonstrated to provide protection against disease from vaccine and non-\nvaccine HPV types to which a person has previously been exposed through sexual activity. [See Clinical \nStudies (14.4, 14.5).]   \nGARDASIL is not intended to be used for treatment of active external genital lesions; cervical, vulvar, \nvaginal, and anal cancers; CIN; VIN; VaIN; or AIN.   \nGARDASIL has not been demonstrated to protect against diseases due to HPV types not contained in \nthe vaccine. [See Clinical Studies (14.4, 14.5).] \nNot all vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers are caused by HPV, and GARDASIL protects only against those \nvulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers caused by HPV 16 and 18. \nGARDASIL does not protect against genital diseases not caused by HPV. \nVaccination with GARDASIL may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients. \nGARDASIL has not been demonstrated to prevent HPV-related CIN 2/3 or worse in women older than \n26 years of age. [See Clinical Studies (14.7).] \n \n3 \n \n2 \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \n2.1 \nDosage \nGARDASIL should be administered intramuscularly as a 0.5-mL dose at the following schedule: 0, 2 \nmonths, 6 months. [See Clinical Studies (14.8).] \n2.2 \nMethod of Administration \nFor intramuscular use only. \nShake well before use. Thorough agitation immediately before administration is necessary to maintain \nsuspension of the vaccine. GARDASIL should not be diluted or mixed with other vaccines. After thorough \nagitation, GARDASIL is a white, cloudy liquid. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for \nparticulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use the product if particulates are present \nor if it appears discolored. \nGARDASIL should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid region of the upper arm or in the higher \nanterolateral area of the thigh.   \nSyncope has been reported following vaccination with GARDASIL and may result in falling with injury; \nobservation for 15 minutes after administration is recommended. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] \nSingle-Dose Vial Use \nWithdraw the 0.5-mL dose of vaccine from the single-dose vial using a sterile needle and syringe and \nuse promptly.  \nPrefilled Syringe Use  \nThis package does not contain a needle. Shake well before use. Attach the needle by twisting in a \nclockwise direction until the needle fits securely on the syringe. Administer the entire dose as per standard \nprotocol. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \nGARDASIL is a suspension for intramuscular administration available in 0.5-mL single dose vials and \nprefilled syringes. See Description (11) for the complete listing of ingredients. \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \nHypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast (a vaccine component), or after a previous \ndose of GARDASIL. [See Description (11).] \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n5.1 \nSyncope \nBecause vaccinees may develop syncope, sometimes resulting in falling with injury, observation for \n15 minutes after administration is recommended. Syncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic \nmovements and other seizure-like activity, has been reported following vaccination with GARDASIL. When \nsyncope is associated with tonic-clonic movements, the activity is usually transient and typically responds \nto restoring cerebral perfusion by maintaining a supine or Trendelenburg position. \n5.2 \nManaging Allergic Reactions  \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision must be readily available in case of anaphylactic \nreactions following the administration of GARDASIL. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS \nOverall Summary of Adverse Reactions \nHeadache, fever, nausea, and dizziness; and local injection site reactions (pain, swelling, erythema, \npruritus, and bruising) occurred after administration with GARDASIL. \nSyncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic movements and other seizure-like activity, has been \nreported following vaccination with GARDASIL and may result in falling with injury; observation for \n15 minutes after administration is recommended. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] \nAnaphylaxis has been reported following vaccination with GARDASIL.  \n \n4 \n \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed \nin the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine \nand may not reflect the rates observed in practice.  \nStudies in Girls and Women (9 Through 45 Years of Age) and Boys and Men (9 Through 26 Years of \nAge) \nIn 7 clinical trials (5 Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate [AAHS]-controlled, 1 saline \nplacebo-controlled, and 1 uncontrolled), 18,083 individuals were administered GARDASIL or AAHS control \nor saline placebo on the day of enrollment, and approximately 2 and 6 months thereafter, and safety was \nevaluated using vaccination report cards (VRC)-aided surveillance for 14 days after each injection of \nGARDASIL or AAHS control or saline placebo in these individuals. The individuals who were monitored \nusing VRC-aided surveillance included 10,088 individuals 9 through 45 years of age at enrollment who \nreceived GARDASIL and 7,995 individuals who received AAHS control or saline placebo. Few individuals \n(0.2%) discontinued due to adverse reactions. The race distribution of the 9- through 26-year-old girls and \nwomen in the safety population was as follows: 62.3% White; 17.6% Hispanic (Black and White); 6.8% \nAsian; 6.7% Other; 6.4% Black; and 0.3% American Indian. The race distribution of the 24- through 45-\nyear-old women in the safety population of Study 6 was as follows: 20.6% White; 43.2% Hispanic (Black \nand White); 0.2% Other; 4.8% Black; 31.2% Asian; and 0.1% American Indian.

Because these events were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not \npossible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.   \n \n10 \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic \npurpura, lymphadenopathy.  \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Pulmonary embolus. \nGastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting. \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Asthenia, chills, death, fatigue, malaise, injection-\nsite nodule.  \nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders: \nAutoimmune \ndiseases, \nhypersensitivity \nreactions \nincluding \nanaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, bronchospasm, and urticaria. \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Arthralgia, myalgia. \nNervous system disorders: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, dizziness, Guillain-Barré syndrome, \nheadache, motor neuron disease, paralysis, seizures, syncope (including syncope associated with tonic-\nclonic movements and other seizure-like activity) sometimes resulting in falling with injury, transverse \nmyelitis.  \nInfections and infestations: Cellulitis. \nVascular disorders: Deep venous thrombosis. \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS \n7.1 \nUse with RECOMBIVAX HB \nResults from clinical studies indicate that GARDASIL may be administered concomitantly (at a separate \ninjection site) with RECOMBIVAX HB [hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant)] [see Clinical Studies (14.10)].  \n7.2 \nUse with Menactra and Adacel \nResults from clinical studies indicate that GARDASIL may be administered concomitantly (at a separate \ninjection site) with Menactra [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid \nConjugate Vaccine] and Adacel [Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis \nVaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)] [see Clinical Studies (14.11)]. \n7.3 \nUse with Hormonal Contraceptives \nIn clinical studies of 16- through 26-year-old women, 13,912 (GARDASIL N = 6952; AAHS control or \nsaline placebo N = 6960) who had post-Month 7 follow-up used hormonal contraceptives for a total of \n33,859 person-years (65.8% of the total follow-up time in the studies).  \nIn one clinical study of 24- through 45-year-old women, 1357 (GARDASIL N = 690; AAHS control N = \n667) who had post-Month 7 follow-up used hormonal contraceptives for a total of 3400 person-years (31.5% \nof the total follow-up time in the study). Use of hormonal contraceptives or lack of use of hormonal \ncontraceptives among study participants did not impair the immune response in the per protocol \nimmunogenicity (PPI) population. \n7.4 \nUse with Systemic Immunosuppressive Medications \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, \nand corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune responses to \nvaccines [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].  \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n8.1 \nPregnancy  \nPregnancy Category B  \nReproduction studies have been performed in female rats at doses equivalent to the recommended \nhuman dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired female fertility or harm to the fetus due to \nGARDASIL. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because \nanimal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human responses, GARDASIL should be used \nduring pregnancy only if clearly needed.   \nAn evaluation of the effect of GARDASIL on embryo-fetal, pre- and postweaning development was \nconducted using rats. One group of rats was administered GARDASIL twice prior to gestation, during the \nperiod of organogenesis (gestation Day 6) and on lactation Day 7. A second group of pregnant rats was \nadministered GARDASIL during the period of organogenesis (gestation Day 6) and on lactation Day 7 only. \n \n11 \n \nGARDASIL was administered at 0.5 mL/rat/occasion (120 mcg total protein which is equivalent to the \nrecommended human dose) by intramuscular injection. No adverse effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy, \nparturition, lactation, embryo-fetal or pre- and postweaning development were observed. There were no \nvaccine-related fetal malformations or other evidence of teratogenesis noted in this study. In addition, there \nwere no treatment-related effects on developmental signs, behavior, reproductive performance, or fertility \nof the offspring.  \nClinical Studies in Humans \nIn clinical studies, women underwent urine pregnancy testing prior to administration of each dose of \nGARDASIL. Women who were found to be pregnant before completion of a 3-dose regimen of GARDASIL \nwere instructed to defer completion of their vaccination regimen until resolution of the pregnancy.  \nGARDASIL is not indicated for women 27 years of age or older. However, safety data in women 16 \nthrough 45 years of age was collected, and 3819 women (GARDASIL N = 1894 vs. AAHS control or saline \nplacebo N = 1925) reported at least 1 pregnancy each. \nThe overall proportions of pregnancies that resulted in an adverse outcome, defined as the combined \nnumbers of spontaneous abortion, late fetal death, and congenital anomaly cases out of the total number \nof pregnancy outcomes for which an outcome was known (and excluding elective terminations), were 22.6% \n(446/1973) in women who received GARDASIL and 23.1% (460/1994) in women who received AAHS \ncontrol or saline placebo. \nOverall, 55 and 65 women in the group that received GARDASIL or AAHS control or saline placebo, \nrespectively (2.9% and 3.4% of all women who reported a pregnancy in the respective vaccination groups), \nexperienced a serious adverse reaction during pregnancy. The most common events reported were \nconditions that can result in Caesarean section (e.g., failure of labor, malpresentation, cephalopelvic \ndisproportion), premature onset of labor (e.g., threatened abortions, premature rupture of membranes), and \npregnancy-related medical problems (e.g., pre-eclampsia, hyperemesis). The proportions of pregnant \nwomen who experienced such events were comparable between the groups receiving GARDASIL and \nAAHS control or saline placebo. \nThere were 45 cases of congenital anomaly in pregnancies that occurred in women who received \nGARDASIL and 34 cases of congenital anomaly in pregnancies that occurred in women who received \nAAHS control or saline placebo. \nFurther sub-analyses were conducted to evaluate pregnancies with estimated onset within 30 days or \nmore than 30 days from administration of a dose of GARDASIL or AAHS control or saline placebo. For \npregnancies with estimated onset within 30 days of vaccination, 5 cases of congenital anomaly were \nobserved in the group that received GARDASIL compared to 1 case of congenital anomaly in the group \nthat received AAHS control or saline placebo. The congenital anomalies seen in pregnancies with estimated \nonset within 30 days of vaccination included pyloric stenosis, congenital megacolon, congenital \nhydronephrosis, hip dysplasia, and club foot. Conversely, in pregnancies with onset more than 30 days \nfollowing vaccination, 40 cases of congenital anomaly were observed in the group that received GARDASIL \ncompared with 33 cases of congenital anomaly in the group that received AAHS control or saline placebo.  \nWomen who receive GARDASIL during pregnancy are encouraged to contact Merck Sharp & \nDohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or VAERS at 1-800-822-7967 or www.vaers.hhs.gov . \n8.3 \nNursing Mothers \nWomen 16 Through 45 Years of Age \nIt is not known whether GARDASIL is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in \nhuman milk, caution should be exercised when GARDASIL is administered to a nursing woman. \nGARDASIL or AAHS control were given to a total of 1133 women (vaccine N = 582, AAHS control N = \n551) during the relevant Phase 3 clinical studies. \nOverall, 27 and 13 infants of women who received GARDASIL or AAHS control, respectively \n(representing 4.6% and 2.4% of the total number of women who were breast-feeding during the period in \nwhich they received GARDASIL or AAHS control, respectively), experienced a serious adverse reaction. \nIn a post-hoc analysis of clinical studies, a higher number of breast-feeding infants (n = 7) whose \nmothers received GARDASIL had acute respiratory illnesses within 30 days post vaccination of the mother \nas compared to infants (n = 2) whose mothers received AAHS control.  \n8.4 \nPediatric Use \nSafety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients below 9 years of age. \n \n12 \n \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use \nThe safety and effectiveness of GARDASIL have not been evaluated in a geriatric population, defined \nas individuals aged 65 years and over.  \n8.6 \nImmunocompromised Individuals \nThe immunologic response to GARDASIL may be diminished in immunocompromised individuals [see \nDrug Interactions (7.4)]. \n10 \nOVERDOSAGE  \nThere have been reports of administration of higher than recommended doses of GARDASIL.   \nIn general, the adverse event profile reported with overdose was comparable to recommended single \ndoses of GARDASIL.  \n11 \nDESCRIPTION \nGARDASIL, Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant, is a \nnon-infectious recombinant quadrivalent vaccine prepared from the purified virus-like particles (VLPs) of \nthe major capsid (L1) protein of HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18. The L1 proteins are produced by separate \nfermentations in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae and self-assembled into VLPs. The fermentation \nprocess involves growth of S. cerevisiae on chemically-defined fermentation media which include vitamins, \namino acids, mineral salts, and carbohydrates. The VLPs are released from the yeast cells by cell disruption \nand purified by a series of chemical and physical methods. The purified VLPs are adsorbed on preformed \naluminum-containing adjuvant (Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate). The quadrivalent HPV \nVLP vaccine is a sterile liquid suspension that is prepared by combining the adsorbed VLPs of each HPV \ntype and additional amounts of the aluminum-containing adjuvant and the final purification buffer. \nGARDASIL is a sterile suspension for intramuscular administration. Each 0.5-mL dose contains \napproximately 20 mcg of HPV 6 L1 protein, 40 mcg of HPV 11 L1 protein, 40 mcg of HPV 16 L1 protein, \nand 20 mcg of HPV 18 L1 protein. \nEach 0.5-mL dose of the vaccine contains approximately 225 mcg of aluminum (as Amorphous \nAluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate adjuvant), 9.56 mg of sodium chloride, 0.78 mg of L-histidine, 50 mcg \nof polysorbate 80, 35 mcg of sodium borate, <7 mcg yeast protein/dose, and water for injection. The product \ndoes not contain a preservative or antibiotics.  \nAfter thorough agitation, GARDASIL is a white, cloudy liquid. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n12.1 Mechanism of Action \nHPV only infects human beings. Animal studies with analogous animal papillomaviruses suggest that \nthe efficacy of L1 VLP vaccines may involve the development of humoral immune responses. Human \nbeings develop a humoral immune response to the vaccine, although the exact mechanism of protection is \nunknown.  \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nGARDASIL has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. \nGARDASIL administered to female rats at a dose of 120 mcg total protein, which is equivalent to the \nrecommended human dose, had no effects on mating performance, fertility, or embryonic/fetal survival.  \nThe effect of GARDASIL on male fertility has been studied in male rats at an intramuscular dose of 0.5 \nmL/rat/occasion (120 mcg total protein which is equivalent to the recommended human dose). One group \nof male rats was administered GARDASIL once, 3 days prior to cohabitation, and a second group of male \nrats was administered GARDASIL three times, at 6 weeks, 3 weeks, and 3 days prior to cohabitation. There \nwere no treatment-related effects on reproductive performance including fertility, sperm count, and sperm \nmotility. There were no treatment-related gross or histomorphologic and weight changes on the testes. \n \n13 \n \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES \nCIN 2/3 and AIS are the immediate and necessary precursors of squamous cell carcinoma and \nadenocarcinoma of the cervix, respectively. Their detection and removal has been shown to prevent cancer; \nthus, they serve as surrogate markers for prevention of cervical cancer. In the clinical studies in girls and \nwomen aged 16 through 26 years, cases of CIN 2/3 and AIS were the efficacy endpoints to assess \nprevention of cervical cancer. In addition, cases of VIN 2/3 and VaIN 2/3 were the efficacy endpoints to \nassess prevention of HPV-related vulvar and vaginal cancers, and observations of external genital lesions \nwere the efficacy endpoints for the prevention of genital warts. \nIn clinical studies in boys and men aged 16 through 26 years, efficacy was evaluated using the following \nendpoints: external genital warts and penile/perineal/perianal intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) grades 1/2/3 \nor penile/perineal/perianal cancer. In addition, cases of AIN grades 1/2/3 and anal cancer made up the \ncomposite efficacy endpoint used to assess prevention of HPV-related anal cancer.  \nAnal HPV infection, AIN, and anal cancer were not endpoints in the studies conducted in women. The \nsimilarity of HPV-related anal disease in men and women supports bridging the indication of prevention of \nAIN and anal cancer to women.   \nEfficacy was assessed in 6 AAHS-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. \nThe first Phase 2 study evaluated the HPV 16 component of GARDASIL (Study 1, N = 2391 16- through \n26-year-old girls and women) and the second evaluated all components of GARDASIL (Study 2, N = 551 \n16- through 26-year-old girls and women). Two Phase 3 studies evaluated GARDASIL in 5442 (Study 3) \nand 12,157 (Study 4) 16- through 26-year-old girls and women. A third Phase 3 study, Study 5, evaluated \nGARDASIL in 4055 16- through 26-year-old boys and men, including a subset of 598 (GARDASIL = 299; \nplacebo = 299) men who self-identified as having sex with men (MSM population). A fourth Phase 3 study, \nStudy 6, evaluated GARDASIL in 3817 24- through 45-year-old women. Together, these six studies \nevaluated 28,413 individuals (20,541 girls and women 16 through 26 years of age at enrollment with a \nmean age of 20.0 years, 4055 boys and men 16 through 26 years of age at enrollment with a mean age of \n20.5 years, and 3817 women 24 through 45 years of age at enrollment with a mean age of 34.3 years). The \nrace distribution of the 16- through 26-year-old girls and women in the clinical trials was as follows: 70.4% \nWhite; 12.2% Hispanic (Black and White); 8.8% Other; 4.6% Black; 3.8% Asian; and 0.2% American Indian. \nThe race distribution of the 16- through 26-year-old boys and men in the clinical trials was as follows: 35.2% \nWhite; 20.5% Hispanic (Black and White); 14.4% Other; 19.8% Black; 10.0% Asian; and 0.1% American \nIndian. The race distribution of the 24- through 45-year-old women in the clinical trials was as follows: 20.6% \nWhite; 43.2% Hispanic (Black and White); 0.2% Other; 4.8% Black; 31.2% Asian; and 0.1% American \nIndian. \nThe median duration of follow-up was 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.3, and 4.0 years for Study 1, Study 2, Study \n3, Study 4, Study 5, and Study 6, respectively. Individuals received vaccine or AAHS control on the day of \nenrollment and 2 and 6 months thereafter. Efficacy was analyzed for each study individually and for all \nstudies in girls and women combined according to a prospective clinical plan.  \nOverall, 73% of 16- through 26-year-old girls and women, 67% of 24- through 45-year-old women, and \n83% of 16- through 26-year-old boys and men were naïve (i.e., PCR [Polymerase Chain Reaction] negative \nand seronegative for all 4 vaccine HPV types) to all 4 vaccine HPV types at enrollment.   \nA total of 27% of 16- through 26-year-old girls and women, 33% of 24- through 45-year-old women, and \n17% of 16- through 26-year-old boys and men had evidence of prior exposure to or ongoing infection with \nat least 1 of the 4 vaccine HPV types. Among these individuals, 74% of 16- through 26-year-old girls and \nwomen, 71% of 24- through 45-year-old women, and 78% of 16- through 26-year-old boys and men had \nevidence of prior exposure to or ongoing infection with only 1 of the 4 vaccine HPV types and were naïve \n(PCR negative and seronegative) to the remaining 3 types. \nIn 24- through 45-year-old individuals, 0.4% had been exposed to all 4 vaccine HPV types.  \nIn individuals who were naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) to all 4 vaccine HPV types, CIN, genital \nwarts, VIN, VaIN, PIN, and persistent infection caused by any of the 4 vaccine HPV types were counted as \nendpoints.  \nAmong individuals who were positive (PCR positive and/or seropositive) for a vaccine HPV type at Day \n1, endpoints related to that type were not included in the analyses of prophylactic efficacy. Endpoints related \nto the remaining types for which the individual was naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) were counted.  \nFor example, in individuals who were HPV 18 positive (PCR positive and/or seropositive) at Day 1, \nlesions caused by HPV 18 were not counted in the prophylactic efficacy evaluations. Lesions caused by \n \n14 \n \nHPV 6, 11, and 16 were included in the prophylactic efficacy evaluations. The same approach was used \nfor the other types. \n14.1 Prophylactic Efficacy – HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in Girls and Women 16 through 26 Years \nof Age  \nGARDASIL was administered without prescreening for presence of HPV infection and the efficacy trials \nallowed enrollment of girls and women regardless of baseline HPV status (i.e., PCR status or serostatus). \nGirls and women with current or prior HPV infection with an HPV type contained in the vaccine were not \neligible for prophylactic efficacy evaluations for that type. \nThe primary analyses of efficacy with respect to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 were conducted in the per-\nprotocol efficacy (PPE) population, consisting of girls and women who received all 3 vaccinations within 1 \nyear of enrollment, did not have major deviations from the study protocol, and were naïve (PCR negative \nin cervicovaginal specimens and seronegative) to the relevant HPV type(s) (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) prior \nto dose 1 and through 1 month postdose 3 (Month 7). Efficacy was measured starting after the Month 7 \nvisit. \nGARDASIL was efficacious in reducing the incidence of CIN (any grade including CIN 2/3); AIS; genital \nwarts; VIN (any grade); and VaIN (any grade) related to vaccine HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 in those who \nwere PCR negative and seronegative at baseline (Table 11). \nIn addition, girls and women who were already infected with 1 or more vaccine-related HPV types prior \nto vaccination were protected from precancerous cervical lesions and external genital lesions caused by \nthe other vaccine HPV types. \n \n \n15 \n \nTable 11: Analysis of Efficacy of GARDASIL in the PPE* Population† of 16- Through 26-Year-Old Girls and Women for \nVaccine HPV Types \nPopulation \nGARDASIL \nAAHS Control \n% Efficacy (95% CI) \nN \nNumber of cases \nN \nNumber of cases \nHPV 16- or 18-related CIN 2/3 or AIS \nStudy 1‡ \n755 \n0 \n750 \n12 \n100.0 (65.1, 100.0) \nStudy 2 \n231 \n0 \n230 \n1 \n100.0 (-3744.9, 100.0) \nStudy 3 \n2201 \n0 \n2222 \n36 \n100.0 (89.2, 100.0) \nStudy 4 \n5306 \n2 \n5262 \n63 \n96.9 (88.2, 99.6) \nCombined Protocols§ \n8493 \n2 \n8464 \n112 \n98.2 (93.5, 99.8) \nHPV 16-related CIN 2/3 or AIS \nCombined Protocols§ \n7402 \n2 \n7205 \n93 \n97.9 (92.3, 99.8) \nHPV 18-related CIN 2/3 or AIS \nCombined Protocols§ \n7382 \n0 \n7316 \n29 \n100.0 (86.6, 100.0) \nHPV 16- or 18-related VIN 2/3 \nStudy 2 \n231 \n0 \n230 \n0 \nNot calculated \nStudy 3 \n2219 \n0 \n2239 \n6 \n100.0 (14.4, 100.0) \nStudy 4 \n5322 \n0 \n5275 \n4 \n100.0 (-50.3, 100.0) \nCombined Protocols§ \n7772 \n0 \n7744 \n10 \n100.0 (55.5, 100.0) \nHPV 16- or 18-related VaIN 2/3 \nStudy 2 \n231 \n0 \n230 \n0 \nNot calculated \nStudy 3 \n2219 \n0 \n2239 \n5 \n100.0 (-10.1, 100.0) \nStudy 4 \n5322 \n0 \n5275 \n4 \n100.0 (-50.3, 100.0) \nCombined Protocols§ \n7772 \n0 \n7744 \n9 \n100.0 (49.5, 100.0) \nHPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related CIN (CIN 1, CIN 2/3) or AIS \nStudy 2 \n235 \n0 \n233 \n3 \n100.0 (-138.4, 100.0) \nStudy 3 \n2241 \n0 \n2258 \n77 \n100.0 (95.1, 100.0) \nStudy 4 \n5388 \n9 \n5374 \n145 \n93.8 (88.0, 97.2) \nCombined Protocols§ \n7864 \n9 \n7865 \n225 \n96.0 (92.3, 98.2) \nHPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related Genital Warts \nStudy 2 \n235 \n0 \n233 \n3 \n100.0 (-139.5, 100.0) \nStudy 3 \n2261 \n0 \n2279 \n58 \n100.0 (93.5, 100.0) \nStudy 4 \n5404 \n2 \n5390 \n132 \n98.5 (94.5, 99.8) \nCombined Protocols§ \n7900 \n2 \n7902 \n193 \n99.0 (96.2, 99.9) \nHPV 6- and 11-related Genital Warts \nCombined Protocols§ \n6932 \n2 \n6856 \n189 \n99.0 (96.2, 99.9) \n*The PPE population consisted of individuals who received all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrollment, did not have major deviations \nfrom the study protocol, and were naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) to the relevant HPV type(s) (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) prior \nto dose 1 and through 1 month postdose 3 (Month 7). \n†See Table 14 for analysis of vaccine impact in the general population. \n‡Evaluated only the HPV 16 L1 VLP vaccine component of GARDASIL \n§Analyses of the combined trials were prospectively planned and included the use of similar study entry criteria. \nN = Number of individuals with at least 1 follow-up visit after Month 7 \nCI = Confidence Interval  \nNote 1: Point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person-time of follow-up. \nNote 2: The first analysis in the table (i.e., HPV 16- or 18-related CIN 2/3, AIS or worse) was the primary endpoint of the vaccine \ndevelopment plan. \nNote 3: Table 11 does not include cases due to non-vaccine HPV types. \nAAHS Control = Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate \n \nProphylactic efficacy against overall cervical and genital disease related to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 in an \nextension phase of Study 2, that included data through Month 60, was noted to be 100% (95% CI: 12.3%, \n100.0%) among girls and women in the per protocol population naïve to the relevant HPV types.  \nGARDASIL was efficacious against HPV disease caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in girls and \nwomen who were naïve for those specific HPV types at baseline. \n14.2 Prophylactic Efficacy – HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in Boys and Men 16 through 26 Years of \nAge \nThe primary analyses of efficacy were conducted in the per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population.

Cross-protective \nefficacy was not demonstrated against disease caused by non-vaccine HPV types in the combined \ndatabase of the Study 3 and Study 4 trials. \n \n21 \n \nGARDASIL does not protect against genital disease not related to HPV. One woman who received \nGARDASIL in Study 3 developed an external genital well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma at Month \n24. No HPV DNA was detected in the lesion or in any other samples taken throughout the study. \nIn 18,150 girls and women enrolled in Study 2, Study 3, and Study 4, GARDASIL reduced definitive \ncervical therapy procedures by 23.9% (95% CI: 15.2%, 31.7%).  \n14.7 Studies in Women 27 through 45 Years of Age \nStudy 6 evaluated efficacy in 3253 women 27 through 45 years of age based on a combined endpoint \nof HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related persistent infection, genital warts, vulvar and vaginal dysplastic lesions of \nany grade, CIN of any grade, AIS, and cervical cancer. These women were randomized 1:1 to receive either \nGARDASIL or AAHS control. The efficacy for the combined endpoint was driven primarily by prevention of \npersistent infection. There was no statistically significant efficacy demonstrated for CIN 2/3, AIS, or cervical \ncancer. In post hoc analyses conducted to assess the impact of GARDASIL on the individual components \nof the combined endpoint, the results in the population of women naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline \nwere as follows: prevention of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related persistent infection (80.5% [95% CI: 68.3, \n88.6]), prevention of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related CIN (any grade) (85.8% [95% CI: 52.4, 97.3]), and \nprevention of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related genital warts (87.6% [95% CI: 7.3, 99.7]).  \nEfficacy for disease endpoints was diminished in a population impact assessment of women who were \nvaccinated regardless of baseline HPV status (full analysis set). In the full analysis set (FAS), efficacy was \nnot demonstrated for the following endpoints: prevention of HPV 16- and 18-related CIN 2/3, AIS, or cervical \ncancer and prevention of HPV 6- and 11-related condyloma. No efficacy was demonstrated against CIN \n2/3, AIS, or cervical cancer in the general population irrespective of HPV type (FAS any type analysis). \n14.8 Immunogenicity \nAssays to Measure Immune Response \nThe minimum anti-HPV titer that confers protective efficacy has not been determined. \nBecause there were few disease cases in individuals naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) to vaccine \nHPV types at baseline in the group that received GARDASIL, it has not been possible to establish minimum \nanti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 antibody levels that protect against clinical disease \ncaused by HPV 6, 11, 16, and/or 18.  \nThe immunogenicity of GARDASIL was assessed in 23,951 9- through 45-year-old girls and women \n(GARDASIL N = 12,634; AAHS control or saline placebo N = 11,317) and 5417 9- through 26-year-old boys \nand men (GARDASIL N = 3109; AAHS control or saline placebo N = 2308).  \nType-specific immunoassays with type-specific standards were used to assess immunogenicity to each \nvaccine HPV type. These assays measured antibodies against neutralizing epitopes for each HPV type. \nThe scales for these assays are unique to each HPV type; thus, comparisons across types and to other \nassays are not appropriate.  \nImmune Response to GARDASIL \nThe primary immunogenicity analyses were conducted in a per-protocol immunogenicity (PPI) \npopulation. This population consisted of individuals who were seronegative and PCR negative to the \nrelevant HPV type(s) at enrollment, remained HPV PCR negative to the relevant HPV type(s) through 1 \nmonth postdose 3 (Month 7), received all 3 vaccinations, and did not deviate from the study protocol in \nways that could interfere with the effects of the vaccine. \nImmunogenicity was measured by (1) the percentage of individuals who were seropositive for antibodies \nagainst the relevant vaccine HPV type, and (2) the Geometric Mean Titer (GMT).  \nIn clinical studies in 16- through 26-year-old girls and women, 99.8%, 99.8%, 99.8%, and 99.4% who \nreceived GARDASIL became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 seropositive, \nrespectively, by 1 month postdose 3 across all age groups tested.  \nIn clinical studies in 27- through 45-year-old women, 98.2%, 97.9%, 98.6%, and 97.1% who received \nGARDASIL became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 seropositive, respectively, by \n1 month postdose 3 across all age groups tested. \nIn clinical studies in 16- through 26-year-old boys and men, 98.9%, 99.2%, 98.8%, and 97.4% who \nreceived GARDASIL became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 seropositive, \nrespectively, by 1 month postdose 3 across all age groups tested.  \nAcross all populations, anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 GMTs peaked at Month \n7 (Table 18 and Table 19). GMTs declined through Month 24 and then stabilized through Month 36 at levels \n \n22 \n \nabove baseline. Tables 20 and 21 display the persistence of anti-HPV cLIA geometric mean titers by gender \nand age group.

An \ninterim analysis of the per-protocol effectiveness population included 1,902 subjects who completed the \nGARDASIL vaccination series within one year, were naïve to the relevant HPV type through 1 month \npostdose 3, had no protocol violations, and had follow-up data available. The median follow-up from initial \nvaccination was 6.7 years with a range of 2.8 to 8.4 years. No cases of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related CIN \n(any grade), AIS, cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, or vaginal cancer were observed over a total of 5,765 \nperson-years at risk. \nAn extension of a Phase 3 study (Study 7) in which 614 girls and 565 boys 9 through 15 years of age at \nenrollment were randomized to vaccination with GARDASIL actively followed subjects for endpoint cases \nof HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related persistent infection, CIN (any grade), AIS, VIN, VaIN, cervical cancer, \nvulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, and genital lesions from the initiation of sexual activity or age 16 onwards. \nAn interim analysis of the per-protocol effectiveness population included 246 girls and 168 boys who \ncompleted the GARDASIL vaccination series within one year, were seronegative to the relevant HPV type \nat initiation of the vaccination series, and had not initiated sexual activity prior to receiving the third dose of \nGARDASIL. The median follow-up, from the first dose of vaccine, was 7.2 years with a range of 0.5 to 8.5 \nyears. No cases of persistent infection of at least 12 months’ duration and no cases of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or \n18-related CIN (any grade), AIS, VIN, VaIN, cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, or genital \nlesions were observed over a total 1,105 person-years at risk. There were 4 cases of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or \n18-related persistent infection of at least 6 months’ duration, including 3 cases related to HPV 16 and 1 \ncase related to HPV 6, none of which persisted to 12 months’ duration.  \nPersistence of the Immune Response  \nThe interim reports of the two extension studies described above included analyses of type-specific anti-\nHPV antibody titers at 9 years postdose 1 for girls and women 16 through 23 years of age at enrollment \n(range of 1,178 to 1,331 subjects with evaluable data across HPV types) and at 8 years postdose 1 for \nboys and girls 9 through 15 years of age at enrollment (range of 436 to 440 subjects with evaluable data \nacross HPV types). Anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs as measured by cLIA were decreased compared \nwith corresponding values at earlier time points, but the proportions of seropositive subjects ranged from \n88.4% to 94.4% for anti-HPV 6, from 89.1% to 95.5% for anti-HPV 11, from 96.8% to 99.1% for anti-HPV \n16, and from 60.0% to 64.1% for anti-HPV 18.  \n14.10 \nStudies with RECOMBIVAX HB [hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant)] \nThe safety and immunogenicity of co-administration of GARDASIL with RECOMBIVAX HB [hepatitis B \nvaccine (recombinant)] (same visit, injections at separate sites) were evaluated in a randomized, double-\nblind, study of 1871 women aged 16 through 24 years at enrollment. The race distribution of the girls and \nwomen in the clinical trial was as follows: 61.6% White; 1.6% Hispanic (Black and White); 23.8% Other; \n11.9% Black; 0.8% Asian; and 0.3% American Indian.  \nSubjects either received GARDASIL and RECOMBIVAX HB (n = 466), GARDASIL and RECOMBIVAX \nHB-matched placebo (n = 468), RECOMBIVAX HB and GARDASIL-matched placebo (n = 467) or \nRECOMBIVAX-matched placebo and GARDASIL-matched placebo (n = 470) at Day 1, Month 2 and Month \n6. Immunogenicity was assessed for all vaccines 1 month post completion of the vaccination series.  \nConcomitant administration of GARDASIL with RECOMBIVAX HB [hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant)] \ndid not interfere with the antibody response to any of the vaccine antigens when GARDASIL was given \nconcomitantly with RECOMBIVAX HB or separately. \n \n27 \n \n14.11 \nStudies with Menactra [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide \nDiphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine] and Adacel [Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and \nAcellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)] \nThe safety and immunogenicity of co-administration of GARDASIL with Menactra [Meningococcal \n(Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine] and Adacel [Tetanus \nToxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)] (same visit, \ninjections at separate sites) were evaluated in an open-labeled, randomized, controlled study of 1040 boys \nand girls 11 through 17 years of age at enrollment. The race distribution of the subjects in the clinical trial \nwas as follows: 77.7% White; 6.8% Hispanic (Black and White); 1.4% Multi-racial; 12.3% Black; 1.2% Asian; \n0.2% Indian; and 0.4% American Indian. \nOne group received GARDASIL in one limb and both Menactra and Adacel, as separate injections, in \nthe opposite limb concomitantly on Day 1 (n = 517). The second group received the first dose of GARDASIL \non Day 1 in one limb then Menactra and Adacel, as separate injections, at Month 1 in the opposite limb (n \n= 523). Subjects in both vaccination groups received the second dose of GARDASIL at Month 2 and the \nthird dose at Month 6. Immunogenicity was assessed for all vaccines 1 month post completion of the \nvaccination series (1 dose for Menactra and Adacel and 3 doses for GARDASIL).  \nConcomitant administration of GARDASIL with Menactra [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) \nPolysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine] and Adacel [Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria \nToxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)] did not interfere with the antibody response to \nany of the vaccine antigens when GARDASIL was given concomitantly with Menactra and Adacel or \nseparately. \n16 \nHOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING \nAll presentations for GARDASIL contain a suspension of 120 mcg L1 protein from HPV types 6, 11, 16, \nand 18 in a 0.5-mL dose.

Do not inject intravascularly or intramuscularly. \n2.1 \nRecommended Dose and Schedule  \nAdminister ZOSTAVAX as a single 0.65-mL dose subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the upper \narm. \n2.2 \nPreparation for Administration \nUse only sterile syringes free of preservatives, antiseptics, and detergents for each injection and/or \nreconstitution of ZOSTAVAX. Preservatives, antiseptics and detergents may inactivate the vaccine virus. \nZOSTAVAX is stored frozen and should be reconstituted immediately upon removal from the freezer.  \nWhen reconstituted, ZOSTAVAX is a semi-hazy to translucent, off-white to pale yellow liquid.  \nReconstitution:  \n• \nUse only the diluent supplied.  \n• \nWithdraw the entire contents of the diluent into a syringe.  \n• \nTo avoid excessive foaming, slowly inject all of the diluent in the syringe into the vial of \nlyophilized vaccine and gently agitate to mix thoroughly. \n• \nWithdraw the entire contents of reconstituted vaccine into a syringe and inject the total volume \nsubcutaneously. \n• \nADMINISTER IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECONSTITUTION to minimize loss of potency. \nDiscard reconstituted vaccine if not used within 30 minutes. Do not freeze reconstituted \nvaccine. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \nZOSTAVAX is a lyophilized preparation of live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus (Oka/Merck) to be \nreconstituted with sterile diluent to give a single dose suspension with a minimum of 19,400 PFU (plaque \nforming units) when stored at room temperature for up to 30 minutes. \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity \nDo not administer ZOSTAVAX to individuals with a history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction to \ngelatin, neomycin or any other component of the vaccine. Neomycin allergy manifested as contact \ndermatitis is not a contraindication to receiving this vaccine. {1}  \n4.2 \nImmunosuppression  \nDo not administer ZOSTAVAX to individuals who are immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to \ndisease or therapy, as serious or fatal disseminated vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus disease may \noccur. Causes of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression may include, but are not limited to, primary or \nacquired immunodeficiency states, AIDS or other clinical manifestations of infection with human \nimmunodeficiency viruses, leukemia, lymphoma or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow \nor lymphatic system, and immunosuppressive therapy. \n4.3 \nPregnancy  \nDo not administer ZOSTAVAX to pregnant women. Naturally occurring varicella-zoster virus (VZV) \ninfection is known to sometimes cause fetal harm. Pregnancy should be avoided for 3 months following \nadministration of ZOSTAVAX [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Patient Counseling Information \n(17)]. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n5.1 \nHypersensitivity Reactions \nSerious adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred with ZOSTAVAX. Adequate treatment \nprovisions, including epinephrine injection (1:1,000), should be available for immediate use should an \nanaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction occur. \n5.2 \nTransmission of Vaccine Virus \nTransmission of vaccine virus may occur between vaccinees and susceptible contacts. \n \n \n3 \n5.3 \nConcurrent Illness \nDeferral should be considered in acute illness (for example, in the presence of fever) or in patients with \nactive untreated tuberculosis. \n5.4 \nLimitations of Vaccine Effectiveness \nVaccination with ZOSTAVAX does not result in protection of all vaccine recipients.  \nThe duration of protection beyond 4 years after vaccination with ZOSTAVAX is unknown. The need for \nrevaccination has not been defined. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS \nThe most frequent adverse reactions, reported in ≥1% of subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX, were \nheadache and injection-site reactions. \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, rates of adverse reactions \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of \nanother vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.  \nZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) in Subjects 50 to 59 Years of Age \nIn the ZEST study, subjects received a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX (N=11,184) or placebo \n(N=11,212). The racial distribution across both vaccination groups was similar: White (94.4%); Black \n(4.2%); Hispanic (3.3%) and Other (1.4%) in both vaccination groups. The gender distribution was 38% \nmale and 62% female in both vaccination groups. The age distribution of subjects enrolled, 50 to 59 years, \nwas similar in both vaccination groups. All subjects received a vaccination report card (VRC) to record \nadverse events occurring from Days 1 to 42 postvaccination. \nIn the ZEST study, serious adverse events occurred at a similar rate in subjects vaccinated with \nZOSTAVAX (0.6%) or placebo (0.5%) from Days 1 to 42 postvaccination. \nIn the ZEST study, all subjects were monitored for adverse reactions. An anaphylactic reaction was \nreported for one subject vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX. \nMost Common Adverse Reactions and Experiences in the ZEST Study \nThe overall incidence of vaccine-related injection-site adverse reactions within 5 days postvaccination \nwas greater for subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX as compared to subjects who received placebo \n(63.6% for ZOSTAVAX and 14.0% for placebo). Injection-site adverse reactions occurring at an incidence \n≥1% within 5 days postvaccination are shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Injection-Site Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥1% of Adults Who Received ZOSTAVAX or \nPlacebo Within 5 Days Postvaccination in the ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial \n \n \n \nInjection-Site \nAdverse Reaction \nZOSTAVAX \n(N = 11094) \n% \nPlacebo \n(N = 11116) \n% \nSolicited* \nPain \nErythema \nSwelling \n \n \n53.9 \n48.1 \n40.4 \n \n9.0 \n4.3 \n2.8 \nUnsolicited \nPruritus \nWarmth \nHematoma \nInduration \n \n \n11.3 \n3.7 \n1.6 \n1.1 \n \n \n0.7 \n0.2 \n1.6 \n0.0 \n \n \n \n*Solicited on the Vaccination Report Card \n \nSystemic adverse reactions and experiences reported during Days 1-42 at an incidence of ≥1% in \neither vaccination group were headache (ZOSTAVAX 9.4%, placebo 8.2%) and pain in the extremity \n(ZOSTAVAX 1.3%, placebo 0.8%), respectively. \nThe overall incidence of systemic adverse experiences reported during Days 1-42 was higher for \nZOSTAVAX (35.4%) than for placebo (33.5%).   \n \n \n4 \nShingles Prevention Study (SPS) in Subjects 60 Years of Age and Older \nIn the SPS, the largest clinical trial of ZOSTAVAX, subjects received a single dose of either \nZOSTAVAX (n=19,270) or placebo (n=19,276). The racial distribution across both vaccination groups was \nsimilar: White (95%); Black (2.0%); Hispanic (1.0%) and Other (1.0%) in both vaccination groups. The \ngender distribution was 59% male and 41% female in both vaccination groups. The age distribution of \nsubjects enrolled, 59-99 years, was similar in both vaccination groups. \nThe Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS, designed to provide detailed data on the safety \nprofile of the zoster vaccine (n=3,345 received ZOSTAVAX and n=3,271 received placebo) used \nvaccination report cards (VRC) to record adverse events occurring from Days 0 to 42 postvaccination \n(97% of subjects completed VRC in both vaccination groups). In addition, monthly surveillance for \nhospitalization was conducted through the end of the study, 2 to 5 years postvaccination. \nThe remainder of subjects in the SPS (n=15,925 received ZOSTAVAX and n=16,005 received \nplacebo) were actively followed for safety outcomes through Day 42 postvaccination and passively \nfollowed for safety after Day 42. \nSerious Adverse Events Occurring 0-42 Days Postvaccination \nIn the overall SPS study population, serious adverse events occurred at a similar rate (1.4%) in \nsubjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX or placebo. \nIn the AE Monitoring Substudy, the rate of SAEs was increased in the group of subjects who received \nZOSTAVAX as compared to the group of subjects who received placebo (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Number of Subjects with ≥1 Serious Adverse Events (0-42 Days Postvaccination) in the \nShingles Prevention Study \n \n \n \nCohort \nZOSTAVAX \nn/N \n% \nPlacebo \nn/N \n% \n \nRelative Risk \n(95% CI) \nOverall Study Cohort \n(60 years of age and older) \n255/18671 \n1.4% \n254/18717 \n1.4% \n1.01  \n(0.85, 1.20) \n60-69 years old \n113/10100 \n1.1% \n101/10095 \n1.0% \n1.12  \n(0.86, 1.46) \n70-79 years old \n115/7351 \n1.6% \n132/7333 \n1.8% \n0.87  \n(0.68, 1.11) \n≥80 years old \n \n27/1220 \n2.2% \n21/1289 \n1.6% \n1.36  \n(0.78, 2.37) \nAE Monitoring Substudy Cohort \n(60 years of age and older) \n64/3326 \n1.9% \n41/3249 \n1.3% \n1.53  \n(1.04, 2.25) \n60-69 years old \n22/1726 \n1.3% \n18/1709 \n1.1% \n1.21  \n(0.66, 2.23) \n70-79 years old \n31/1383 \n2.2% \n19/1367 \n1.4% \n1.61  \n(0.92, 2.82) \n≥80 years old \n \n11/217 \n5.1% \n4/173 \n2.3% \n2.19  \n(0.75, 6.45) \nN=number of subjects in cohort with safety follow-up \nn=number of subjects reporting an SAE 0-42 Days postvaccination \n \nAmong reported serious adverse events in the SPS (Days 0 to 42 postvaccination), serious \ncardiovascular events occurred more frequently in subjects who received ZOSTAVAX (20 [0.6%]) than in \nsubjects who received placebo (12 [0.4%]) in the AE Monitoring Substudy. The frequencies of serious \ncardiovascular events were similar in subjects who received ZOSTAVAX (81 [0.4%]) and in subjects who \nreceived placebo (72 [0.4%]) in the entire study cohort (Days 0 to 42 postvaccination). \n \n \n5 \nSerious Adverse Events Occurring Over the Entire Course of the Study \nRates of hospitalization were similar among subjects who received ZOSTAVAX and subjects who \nreceived placebo in the AE Monitoring Substudy, throughout the entire study. \nFifty-one individuals (1.5%) receiving ZOSTAVAX were reported to have congestive heart failure (CHF) \nor pulmonary edema compared to 39 individuals (1.2%) receiving placebo in the AE Monitoring Substudy; \n58 individuals (0.3%) receiving ZOSTAVAX were reported to have congestive heart failure (CHF) or \npulmonary edema compared to 45 (0.2%) individuals receiving placebo in the overall study. \nIn the SPS, all subjects were monitored for vaccine-related SAEs. Investigator-determined, vaccine-\nrelated serious adverse experiences were reported for 2 subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX (asthma \nexacerbation and polymyalgia rheumatica) and 3 subjects who received placebo (Goodpasture’s \nsyndrome, anaphylactic reaction, and polymyalgia rheumatica). \nDeaths  \nThe incidence of death was similar in the groups receiving ZOSTAVAX or placebo during the Days 0-\n42 postvaccination period; 14 deaths occurred in the group of subjects who received ZOSTAVAX and 16 \ndeaths occurred in the group of subjects who received placebo. The most common reported cause of \ndeath was cardiovascular disease (10 in the group of subjects who received ZOSTAVAX, 8 in the group of \nsubjects who received placebo). The overall incidence of death occurring at any time during the study was \nsimilar between vaccination groups: 793 deaths (4.1%) occurred in subjects who received ZOSTAVAX \nand 795 deaths (4.1%) in subjects who received placebo. \nMost Common Adverse Reactions and Experiences in the AE Monitoring Substudy of the SPS \nInjection-site adverse reactions reported at an incidence ≥1% are shown in Table 3. Most of these \nadverse reactions were reported as mild in intensity. The overall incidence of vaccine-related injection-site \nadverse reactions was significantly greater for subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX versus subjects who \nreceived placebo (48% for ZOSTAVAX and 17% for placebo). \n \nTable 3: Injection-Site Adverse Reactions* in ≥1% of Adults Who Received ZOSTAVAX or Placebo \nWithin 5 Days Postvaccination from the AE Monitoring Substudy of the Shingles Prevention Study \n \n \n \nAdverse Reaction \nZOSTAVAX \n(N = 3345) \n% \nPlacebo \n(N = 3271) \n% \nSolicited† \nErythema \nPain/Tenderness \nSwelling \n \n35.6 \n34.3 \n26.1 \n \n6.9 \n8.3 \n4.5 \nUnsolicited \nHematoma \nPruritus \nWarmth \n \n1.6 \n6.9 \n1.6 \n \n1.4 \n1.0 \n0.3 \n \n*Patients instructed to report adverse experiences on a Vaccination Report Card \n \n†Solicited on the Vaccination Report Card \n \nHeadache was the only systemic adverse reaction reported on the vaccine report card between Days \n0-42 by ≥1% of subjects in the AE Monitoring Substudy in either vaccination group (ZOSTAVAX 1.4%, \nplacebo 0.8%). \nThe numbers of subjects with elevated temperature (≥38.3ºC [≥101.0ºF]) within 42 days \npostvaccination were similar in the ZOSTAVAX and the placebo vaccination groups [27 (0.8%) vs. 27 \n(0.9%), respectively]. \nThe following adverse experiences in the AE Monitoring Substudy of the SPS (Days 0 to 42 \npostvaccination) were reported at an incidence ≥1% and greater in subjects who received ZOSTAVAX \nthan in subjects who received placebo, respectively: respiratory infection (65 [1.9%] vs. 55 [1.7%]), fever \n(59 [1.8%] vs. 53 [1.6%]), flu syndrome (57 [1.7%] vs. 52 [1.6%]), diarrhea (51 [1.5%] vs. 41 [1.3%]), \nrhinitis (46 [1.4%] vs. 36 [1.1%]), skin disorder (35 [1.1%] vs. 31 [1.0%]), respiratory disorder (35 [1.1%] \nvs. 27 [0.8%]), asthenia (32 [1.0%] vs. 14 [0.4%]).  \n6.2 \nVZV Rashes Following Vaccination \nWithin the 42-day postvaccination reporting period in the ZEST, noninjection-site zoster-like rashes \nwere reported by 34 subjects (19 for ZOSTAVAX and 15 for placebo). Of 24 specimens that were \nadequate for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing, wild-type VZV was detected in 10 (3 for \n \n \n6 \nZOSTAVAX, 7 for placebo) of these specimens. The Oka/Merck strain of VZV was not detected from any \nof these specimens. Of reported varicella-like rashes (n=124, 69 for ZOSTAVAX and 55 for placebo), 23 \nhad specimens that were available and adequate for PCR testing. VZV was detected in one of these \nspecimens in the ZOSTAVAX group; however, the virus strain (wild-type or Oka/Merck strain) could not be \ndetermined. \nWithin the 42-day postvaccination reporting period in the SPS, noninjection-site zoster-like rashes were \nreported by 53 subjects (17 for ZOSTAVAX and 36 for placebo). Of 41 specimens that were adequate for \nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing, wild-type VZV was detected in 25 (5 for ZOSTAVAX, 20 for \nplacebo) of these specimens. The Oka/Merck strain of VZV was not detected from any of these \nspecimens. Of reported varicella-like rashes (n=59), 10 had specimens that were available and adequate \nfor PCR testing. VZV was not detected in any of these specimens. \nIn clinical trials in support of the initial licensure of the frozen formulation of ZOSTAVAX, the reported \nrates of noninjection-site zoster-like and varicella-like rashes within 42 days postvaccination were also low \nin both zoster vaccine and placebo recipients. Of 17 reported varicella-like rashes and non-injection site \nzoster-like rashes, 10 specimens were available and adequate for PCR testing, and 2 subjects \nhad varicella (onset Day 8 and 17) confirmed to be Oka/Merck strain. \n6.3 \nPost-Marketing Experience \nThe following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing use of \nZOSTAVAX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is \ngenerally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the vaccine. \nGastrointestinal disorders: nausea \nInfections and infestations: vaccine strain herpes zoster; disseminated vaccine strain varicella-zoster \nvirus disease including fatal outcomes in immunocompromised patients \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia; myalgia \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: injection-site rash; pyrexia; injection-site urticaria; \ntransient injection-site lymphadenopathy \nImmune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions  \nEye Disorders: necrotizing retinitis (patients on immunosuppressive therapy) \nNervous system disorders: Guillain-Barré syndrome; facial paralysis \nReporting Adverse Events \nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established a Vaccine Adverse Event \nReporting System (VAERS) to accept all reports of suspected adverse events after the administration of \nany vaccine.

Consider \nadministration of the two vaccines separated by at least 4 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. \nFor concomitant administration of ZOSTAVAX with inactivated influenza vaccine [see Clinical Studies \n(14.4)]. \n7.2 \nAntiviral Medications \nConcurrent administration of ZOSTAVAX and antiviral medications known to be effective against VZV \nhas not been evaluated. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n8.1 \nPregnancy \nRisk Summary \nZOSTAVAX is contraindicated for use in pregnant women because the vaccine contains live, \nattenuated varicella-zoster virus, and it is known that wild-type varicella-zoster virus, if acquired during \npregnancy, can cause congenital varicella syndrome [see Contraindications (4.3) and Patient Counseling \nInformation (17)]. \n \n \n7 \nAvailable data on inadvertent administration of ZOSTAVAX to pregnant women are insufficient to \ninform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general \npopulation, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized \npregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. \n8.2 \nLactation \nRisk Summary \nIt is not known whether varicella-zoster vaccine virus is excreted in human milk. The developmental \nand health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for \nZOSTAVAX, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ZOSTAVAX or from the \nunderlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility \nto disease prevented by the vaccine. \n8.4 \nPediatric Use \nZOSTAVAX is not indicated for prevention of primary varicella infection (Chickenpox) and should not \nbe used in children and adolescents. \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use \nThe median age of subjects enrolled in the largest (N=38,546) clinical study of ZOSTAVAX was \n69 years (range 59-99 years). Of the 19,270 subjects who received ZOSTAVAX, 10,378 were 60-69 years \nof age, 7,629 were 70-79 years of age, and 1,263 were 80 years of age or older. \n11 \nDESCRIPTION \nZOSTAVAX is a lyophilized preparation of the Oka/Merck strain of live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus \n(VZV). ZOSTAVAX, when reconstituted as directed, is a sterile suspension for subcutaneous \nadministration. Each 0.65-mL dose contains a minimum of 19,400 PFU (plaque-forming units) of \nOka/Merck strain of VZV when reconstituted and stored at room temperature for up to 30 minutes. \nEach dose contains 31.16 mg of sucrose, 15.58 mg of hydrolyzed porcine gelatin, 3.99 mg of sodium \nchloride, 0.62 mg of monosodium L-glutamate, 0.57 mg of sodium phosphate dibasic, 0.10 mg of \npotassium phosphate monobasic, 0.10 mg of potassium chloride; residual components of MRC-5 cells \nincluding DNA and protein; and trace quantities of neomycin and bovine calf serum. The product contains \nno preservatives. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n12.1 Mechanism of Action \nThe risk of developing zoster appears to be related to a decline in VZV-specific immunity. ZOSTAVAX \nwas shown to boost VZV-specific immunity, which is thought to be the mechanism by which it protects \nagainst zoster and its complications. [See Clinical Studies (14).] \nHerpes zoster (HZ), commonly known as shingles or zoster, is a manifestation of the reactivation of \nvaricella zoster virus (VZV), which, as a primary infection, produces chickenpox (varicella). Following initial \ninfection, the virus remains latent in the dorsal root or cranial sensory ganglia until it reactivates, producing \nzoster. Zoster is characterized by a unilateral, painful, vesicular cutaneous eruption with a dermatomal \ndistribution.   \nPain associated with zoster may occur during the prodrome, the acute eruptive phase, and the \npostherpetic phase of the infection. Pain occurring in the postherpetic phase of infection is commonly \nreferred to as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). \nSerious complications, such as PHN, scarring, bacterial superinfection, allodynia, cranial and motor \nneuron palsies, pneumonia, encephalitis, visual impairment, hearing loss, and death can occur as the \nresult of zoster. \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nZOSTAVAX has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or its potential to \nimpair fertility. \n \n \n8 \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES \nIn two large clinical trials (ZEST and SPS), ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced the risk of developing zoster \nwhen compared with placebo (see Table 4 and Table 5). \n14.1 ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) in Subjects 50 to 59 Years of Age \nEfficacy of ZOSTAVAX was evaluated in the ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST), a placebo-\ncontrolled, double-blind clinical trial in which 22,439 subjects 50 to 59 years of age were randomized to \nreceive a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX (n=11,211) or placebo (n=11,228). Subjects were followed for \nthe development of zoster for a median of 1.3 years (range 0 to 2 years). Confirmed zoster cases were \ndetermined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) [86%] or, in the absence of virus detection, by a Clinical \nEvaluation Committee [14%]. The primary efficacy analysis included all subjects randomized in the study \n(intent-to-treat [ITT] analysis). \nCompared with placebo, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced the risk of developing zoster by 69.8% (95% \nCI: 54.1, 80.6%) in subjects 50 to 59 years of age (Table 4). \n \nTable 4: Efficacy of ZOSTAVAX on HZ Incidence Compared with Placebo in the ZOSTAVAX \nEfficacy and Safety Trial* \n \n \n \nZOSTAVAX \n \nPlacebo \n \nAge group \n(yrs.) \n# subjects \n# HZ \ncases \nIncidence \nrate of HZ \nper 1000 \nperson-yrs. \n# subjects \n# HZ \ncases \nIncidence \nrate of HZ \nper 1000 \nperson-yrs. \nVaccine Efficacy \n(95% CI) \n \n \n50-59 \n \n11211 \n \n30 \n \n1.994 \n \n11228 \n \n99 \n \n6.596 \n \n69.8% (54.1%, 80.6%) \n \n*The analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population that included all subjects randomized in the ZEST study. \n \nImmune responses to vaccination were evaluated in a random 10% subcohort (n=1,136 for \nZOSTAVAX and n=1,133 for placebo) of the subjects enrolled in the ZEST study. VZV antibody levels \n(Geometric Mean Titers, GMT), as measured by glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \n(gpELISA) 6 weeks postvaccination, were increased 2.3-fold (95% CI: 2.2, 2.4) in the group of subjects \nwho received ZOSTAVAX compared to subjects who received placebo; the specific antibody level that \ncorrelates with protection from zoster has not been established. \n14.2 Shingles Prevention Study (SPS) in Subjects 60 Years of Age and Older \nEfficacy of ZOSTAVAX was evaluated in the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS), a placebo-controlled, \ndouble-blind clinical trial in which 38,546 subjects 60 years of age or older were randomized to receive a \nsingle dose of either ZOSTAVAX (n=19,270) or placebo (n=19,276). Subjects were followed for the \ndevelopment of zoster for a median of 3.1 years (range 31 days to 4.90 years). The study excluded people \nwho were immunocompromised or using corticosteroids on a regular basis, anyone with a previous history \nof HZ, and those with conditions that might interfere with study evaluations, including people with cognitive \nimpairment, severe hearing loss, those who were non-ambulatory, and those whose survival was not \nconsidered to be at least 5 years. Randomization was stratified by age, 60-69 and ≥70 years of age. \nSuspected zoster cases were confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) [93%], viral culture [1%], or \nin the absence of virus detection, as determined by a Clinical Evaluation Committee [6%]. Individuals in \nboth vaccination groups who developed zoster were given famciclovir, and, as necessary, pain \nmedications. The primary efficacy analysis included all subjects randomized in the study who were \nfollowed for at least 30 days postvaccination and did not develop an evaluable case of HZ within the first \n30 days postvaccination (Modified Intent-To-Treat [MITT] analysis). \nZOSTAVAX significantly reduced the risk of developing zoster when compared with placebo (Table 5). \nIn the SPS, vaccine efficacy for the prevention of HZ was highest for those subjects 60-69 years of age \nand declined with increasing age.  \n \nTable 5: Efficacy of ZOSTAVAX on HZ Incidence Compared with Placebo in the Shingles \nPrevention Study* \n \n \n \n9 \n \n \nZOSTAVAX \n \nPlacebo \n \nAge group† \n(yrs.) \n# subjects \n# HZ \ncases \nIncidence rate \nof HZ per 1000 \nperson-yrs. \n# subjects \n# HZ \ncases \nIncidence rate \nof HZ per \n1000 person-\nyrs. \nVaccine Efficacy \n(95% CI) \n \nOverall \n19254 \n315 \n5.4 \n19247 \n642 \n11.1 \n51% (44%, 58%) \n60-69 \n10370 \n122 \n3.9 \n10356 \n334 \n10.8 \n64% (56%, 71%) \n70-79 \n7621 \n156 \n6.7 \n7559 \n261 \n11.4 \n41% (28%, 52%) \n≥80 \n1263 \n37 \n9.9 \n1332 \n47 \n12.2 \n18% (-29%, 48%) \n * The analysis was performed on the Modified Intent-To-Treat (MITT) population that included all subjects randomized in the study \nwho were followed for at least 30 days postvaccination and did not develop an evaluable case of HZ within the first 30 days \npostvaccination.  \n † Age strata at randomization were 60-69 and ≥70 years of age. \n \nForty-five subjects were excluded from the MITT analysis (16 in the group of subjects who received \nZOSTAVAX and 29 in the group of subjects who received placebo), including 24 subjects with evaluable \nHZ cases that occurred in the first 30 days postvaccination (6 evaluable HZ cases in the group of subjects \nwho received ZOSTAVAX and 18 evaluable HZ cases in the group of subjects who received placebo). \nSuspected HZ cases were followed prospectively for the development of HZ-related complications. \nTable 6 compares the rates of PHN defined as HZ-associated pain (rated as 3 or greater on a 10-point \nscale by the study subject and occurring or persisting at least 90 days) following the onset of rash in \nevaluable cases of HZ.  \n \nTable 6: Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN)* in the Shingles Prevention Study† \n \n \n \nZOSTAVAX \n \nPlacebo \n \nAge \ngroup \n(yrs.)‡ \n# \nsubjects \n# HZ \ncases \n# PHN \ncases \nIncidence \nrate of \nPHN per \n1,000 \nperson-\nyrs. \n% HZ \ncases \nwith \nPHN \n# \nsubjects \n# HZ \ncases \n# PHN \ncases \nIncidence \nrate of \nPHN per \n1,000 \nperson-\nyrs. \n% HZ \ncases \nwith \nPHN \nVaccine efficacy \nagainst PHN in \nsubjects who \ndevelop HZ \npostvaccination \n(95% CI) \n \nOverall \n19254 \n315 \n27 \n0.5 \n8.6% \n19247 \n642 \n80 \n1.4 \n12.5% \n39%§  \n(7%, 59%) \n60-69 \n10370 \n122 \n8 \n0.3 \n6.6% \n10356 \n334 \n23 \n0.7 \n6.9% \n5%  \n(-107%, 56%) \n70-79 \n7621 \n156 \n12 \n0.5 \n7.7% \n7559 \n261 \n45 \n2.0 \n17.2% \n55%  \n(18%, 76%) \n≥80 \n1263 \n37 \n7 \n1.9 \n18.9% \n1332 \n47 \n12 \n3.1 \n25.5% \n26%  \n(-69%, 68%) \n * PHN was defined as HZ-associated pain rated as ≥3 (on a 0-10 scale), persisting or appearing more than 90 days after onset \nof HZ rash using Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI). {5}  \n † The table is based on the Modified Intent-To-Treat (MITT) population that included all subjects randomized in the study who \nwere followed for at least 30 days postvaccination and did not develop an evaluable case of HZ within the first 30 days \npostvaccination. \n ‡ Age strata at randomization were 60-69 and ≥70 years of age. \n § Age-adjusted estimate based on the age strata (60-69 and ≥70 years of age) at randomization. \n \nThe median duration of clinically significant pain (defined as ≥3 on a 0-10 point scale) among HZ cases \nin the group of subjects who received ZOSTAVAX as compared to the group of subjects who received \nplacebo was 20 days vs. 22 days based on the confirmed HZ cases. \nOverall, the benefit of ZOSTAVAX in the prevention of PHN can be primarily attributed to the effect of \nthe vaccine on the prevention of herpes zoster. Vaccination with ZOSTAVAX in the SPS reduced the \nincidence of PHN in individuals 70 years of age and older who developed zoster postvaccination. Other \nprespecified zoster-related complications were reported less frequently in subjects who received \nZOSTAVAX compared to subjects who received placebo. Among HZ cases, zoster-related complications \nwere reported at similar rates in both vaccination groups (Table 7). \n \nTable 7: Specific complications* of zoster among HZ cases in the Shingles Prevention Study \n \n \n10\n \n \nComplication \n \nZOSTAVAX \n(N = 19270) \n \nPlacebo \n(N = 19276) \n \n \n(n = 321) \n \n% Among \nZoster Cases \n(n = 659) \n \n% Among \nZoster Cases \nAllodynia \n135 \n42.1 \n310 \n47.0 \nBacterial Superinfection \n3 \n0.9 \n7 \n1.1 \nDissemination \n5 \n1.6 \n11 \n1.7 \nImpaired Vision \n2 \n0.6 \n9 \n1.4 \nOphthalmic Zoster \n35 \n10.9 \n69 \n10.5 \nPeripheral Nerve Palsies (motor) \n5 \n1.6 \n12 \n1.8 \nPtosis \n2 \n0.6 \n9 \n1.4 \nScarring \n24 \n7.5 \n57 \n8.6 \nSensory Loss \n7 \n2.2 \n12 \n1.8 \nN=number of subjects randomized \nn=number of zoster cases, including those cases occurring within 30 days postvaccination, with these data available  \n* Complications reported at a frequency of ≥1% in at least one vaccination group among subjects with zoster \n \nVisceral complications reported by fewer than 1% of subjects with zoster included 3 cases of \npneumonitis and 1 case of hepatitis in the placebo group, and 1 case of meningoencephalitis in the \nvaccine group. \nImmune responses to vaccination were evaluated in a subset of subjects enrolled in the Shingles \nPrevention Study (N=1,395). VZV antibody levels (Geometric Mean Titers, GMT), as measured by \nglycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) 6 weeks postvaccination, were increased \n1.7-fold (95% CI: 1.6 to 1.8) in the group of subjects who received ZOSTAVAX compared to subjects who \nreceived placebo; the specific antibody level that correlates with protection from zoster has not been \nestablished. \n14.3 Long-Term Effectiveness Study in Individuals 50 Years of Age or Older  \nAn interim analysis of a prospective observational cohort study conducted in a US integrated \nhealthcare system database estimated vaccine effectiveness against HZ and PHN among 1,355,720 \nindividuals 50 years of age and older, including 392,677 who received ZOSTAVAX. Age eligible individuals \ncontributed person-time to the unvaccinated group and, once vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX, contributed \nperson-time to the vaccinated group for the remainder of the study. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against HZ \nand PHN was calculated using the incidence rates of protocol-defined first episode of HZ and PHN in the \nvaccinated and unvaccinated groups, including adjustments for calendar time, age, sex, race/ethnicity, \nhealthcare resource utilization, comorbid conditions, and immunocompromise status. The gender and \nracial/ethnic distributions of study individuals were overall 53% female, 60% white, 15% Asian or Pacific \nIslander, 13% Hispanic, and 7% black or African American. \nFor individuals 50-59 years of age at the time of vaccination, the average VE against HZ over the first 3 \nyears following vaccination was 60% (95% CI: 52, 66), with VE against HZ of 36% (95% CI: -55, 73) in the \nthird year post-vaccination. For individuals 60-69 years of age, 70-79 years of age, and 80 years of age \nand older at the time of vaccination, the average VE against HZ over the first 5 years following vaccination \nwas 49% (95% CI: 47, 52), 46% (95% CI: 43, 48), and 44% (95% CI: 38, 49), respectively, with VE against \nHZ of 34% (95% CI: 25, 42), 29% (95% CI: 18, 38), and 36% (95% CI: 12, 53), respectively, in the fifth \nyear post-vaccination. Follow-up time for individuals 50-59 years of age was shorter because ZOSTAVAX \nwas approved for use in this age group five years after approval for use in individuals 60 years of age and \nolder. \nInsufficient data were available at the time of the interim analysis to assess the outcome of PHN in \nindividuals 50-59 years of age. For individuals 60-69 years of age, 70-79 years of age, and 80 years of \nage and older at the time of vaccination, the average VE against PHN over the first 5 years following \nvaccination was 72% (95% CI: 65, 77), 69% (95% CI: 62, 75), and 61% (95% CI: 47, 71), respectively, \nwith VE against PHN of 61% (95% CI: 33, 77), 69% (95% CI: 44, 82), and 34% (95% CI: -49, 71), \nrespectively, in the fifth year post-vaccination. The benefit of ZOSTAVAX in the prevention of PHN can be \nattributed in part to the effect of the vaccine on the prevention of HZ. \n \n \n11\n14.4 Concomitant Use Studies \nIn a double-blind, controlled substudy, 374 adults in the US, 60 years of age and older (median age = \n66 years), were randomized to receive trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and ZOSTAVAX \nconcurrently (N=188), or TIV alone followed 4 weeks later by ZOSTAVAX alone (N=186). The antibody \nresponses to both vaccines at 4 weeks postvaccination were similar in both groups. \nIn another double-blind, controlled study, 882 adults in the US, 50 years of age and older (median \nage = 60 years), were randomized to receive quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and ZOSTAVAX \nconcurrently (N=440), or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine alone followed 4 weeks later by \nZOSTAVAX alone (N=442). The antibody responses to both vaccines at 4 weeks postvaccination were \nsimilar in both groups. \nIn a double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 473 adults, 60 years of age or older, were randomized to \nreceive ZOSTAVAX and PNEUMOVAX 23 concomitantly (N=237), or PNEUMOVAX 23 alone followed 4 \nweeks later by ZOSTAVAX alone (N=236). At 4 weeks postvaccination, the VZV antibody levels following \nconcomitant use were significantly lower than the VZV antibody levels following nonconcomitant \nadministration (GMTs of 338 vs. 484 gpELISA units/mL, respectively; GMT ratio = 0.70 (95% CI: 0.61, \n0.80). \n15 \nREFERENCES \n1. \nReitschel RL, Bernier R.

Shake well prior to administration to thoroughly \nmix the vaccine suspension. After shaking, the vaccine should be a homogenous off-white, opalescent \nsuspension. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior \nto administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer if particulate matter or \ndiscoloration remains after shaking. Administer vaccine by intramuscular injection. \n \n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \n \nTICOVAC is a suspension for injection supplied as a 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL single-dose in pre-filled syringes. \n \n3 \n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS \n \nSevere allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to any component of TICOVAC [see Description (11)]. \n \n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n \n5.1 Management of Acute Allergic Reactions \n \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions \nfollowing administration of TICOVAC. \n \n5.2 Altered Immunocompetence \n \nSome individuals with altered immunocompetence may have reduced immune responses to TICOVAC. \n \n5.3 \nHuman Albumin \n \nTICOVAC contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product \nmanufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases and variant \nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). There is a theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease \n(CJD), but if that risk actually exists, the risk of transmission would also be considered extremely remote. No \ncases of transmission of viral diseases, CJD or vCJD have ever been identified for licensed albumin or albumin \ncontained in other licensed products. \n \n5.4 Limitation of Vaccine Effectiveness \n \nVaccination with TICOVAC may not protect all individuals. \n \n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \n \nIn clinical studies, the most common adverse reactions in subjects 1 through 15 years of age who received \nTICOVAC were local tenderness (18.1%), local pain (11.2%), headache (11.1%), fever (9.6%), and restlessness \n(9.1%). \n \nThe most common adverse reactions in subjects 16 through 65 years of age who received TICOVAC were local \ntenderness (29.9%), local pain (13.2%), fatigue (6.6%), headache (6.3%), and muscle pain (5.1%). \n \n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience \n \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the \nclinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may \nnot reflect the rates observed in practice. \n \nAmong a total of 10 clinical trials, 3240 healthy children 1 through 15 years of age received at least one dose of \nTICOVAC. A total of 4427 healthy adults 16 years of age and older received at least one dose of TICOVAC in \n10 clinical trials. \n \nStudy 209 was a multicenter, open-label study to investigate the safety of TICOVAC in 2,417 healthy children \n1 through 15 years of age who received three vaccinations (Day 0, 1 and 6 months after the first vaccination). \nThe incidence rates for local and systemic solicited adverse reactions within 4 days after each dose are \npresented in Table 2. \n4 \n \nTable 2: \nIncidence Rates of Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions Within 4 Days After Each \nDose of TICOVAC, Children 1 through 15 Years of Age (Study 209) \n \n \nPercentage (%) of Subjects  \nAge \nGroupa \nAdverse Reaction \nDose 1 \nN=2417  \nDose 2 \nN=2410  \nDose 3 \nN=2390  \nLocal Reaction \n1-15 Years \nTenderness \n18.1  \n12.9  \n13.3  \n \nLocal pain \n11.2 \n7.9  \n9.7  \n \nErythema \n3.0 \n1.5 \n2.8             \n \nInduration \n2.2 \n1.3 \n2.1 \n \nSwelling \n1.9 \n1.1  \n2.5  \n \nItching \n<0.1 \n<0.1  \n0 \n \nEcchymosis \n0 \n0 \n<0.1 \n \nHematoma \n<0.1 \n0 \n0 \nSystemic Reaction \n1-15 Years \nFever \n9.6 \n2.3 \n2.4 \n \nHeadache \n11.1  \n3.9 \n3.4 \n \nMuscle pain \n3.6  \n2.0 \n1.8  \n \nLoss of appetite \n3.1  \n1.5 \n1.2  \n \nNausea \n3.3  \n1.0 \n0.8  \n \nChanges in sleeping \nbehavior \n2.8 \n1.0  \n0.8 \n \nVomiting \n1.7  \n0.7  \n0.3  \n \nJoint pain \n1.2  \n0.6  \n0.5  \n \nSwelling of the axillary \n/inguinal lymph nodes \n0.2 \n0.3 \n0.2 \n \n \nN=584  \nN=581 \nN=576 \n1-5 Years \nRestlessness \n9.1 \n3.6 \n3.5 \n \n \nN=1833 \nN=1829 \nN=1814 \n6-15 Years \nFatigue \n6.3 \n2.4 \n2.5  \n \nMalaise \n4.8 \n1.6  \n1.8 \nAbbreviation: N=total number of subjects who received TICOVAC at each dose for each age group. \nClinical trial identifier: NCT 00161863. \na.

Among 4427 subjects who received TICOVAC \n(0.5 mL) in clinical trials, SAEs and deaths were reported in 54 subjects and 2 subjects, respectively. None of \nthese events was considered related to the vaccine. Only one SAE in TICOVAC (0.25 mL) was considered \npossibly related to vaccine (febrile convulsion reported in a 12-month old male two days after vaccination in \nStudy 197, a postmarketing safety surveillance study).  \n \n6.2 Postmarketing Experience  \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported spontaneously (postmarketing) with the use of TICOVAC \nin the European Union (EU). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain \nsize, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine \nexposure. \n \n• Infections and infestations: herpes zoster (triggered in pre-exposed individuals) \n• Immune system disorders: anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity, precipitation or aggravation of \nautoimmune disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis) \n• Nervous system disorders: convulsion, convulsion (including febrile), demyelinating disorders (acute \ndisseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myelitis, transverse myelitis), encephalitis, \nsensory abnormalities and motor dysfunction (hemiparesis, hemiplegia, VIIth nerve paralysis/facial \nparesis, paralysis, paresis, neuritis, neuralgia, optic neuritis), polyneuropathy, meningism, \ndizziness, aseptic meningitis \n• Eye disorders: visual impairment, photophobia, eye pain  \n• Ear and labyrinth disorders: tinnitus \n• Cardiac disorders: tachycardia \n• Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea \n• Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, rash (erythematous, maculo-papular, vesicular), \npruritus, dermatitis, erythema, hyperhidrosis \n• Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: back pain, joint swelling, neck pain, musculoskeletal \nstiffness (including neck stiffness), pain in extremity \n• General disorders and administration site conditions: injection site joint movement impairment, injection \nsite joint pain, injection site nodule, injection site inflammation, influenza-like illness, chills, gait \ndisturbance, asthenia, edema \n \n \n8 \n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n \n8.1 Pregnancy \n \nRisk Summary  \n \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the \nestimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to \n4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of TICOVAC in pregnant \nwomen. Available human data are insufficient to establish the presence or absence of vaccine-associated risk \nduring pregnancy. \n \nDevelopmental and reproductive toxicity studies in animals have not been conducted with TICOVAC. \n \n8.2 Lactation  \n \nRisk Summary  \n \nHuman data are not available to assess the impact of TICOVAC on milk production, its presence in breast milk, \nor its effects on the breastfed. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered \nalong with the mother’s clinical need for TICOVAC and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child \nfrom TICOVAC or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal \ncondition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. \n \n8.4 Pediatric Use \n \nSafety and effectiveness of TICOVAC have not been established in infants below 1 year of age. \n \n8.5 Geriatric Use \n \nClinical studies of TICOVAC did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine \nwhether they respond differently from younger subjects. A clinical study (Study 690601, NCT00460486) of \nTICOVAC enrolled 73 subjects 60 years of age and older, including 31 subjects 65 years of age and older.  \n \n11 DESCRIPTION  \n \nTICOVAC (tick-borne encephalitis vaccine) is a sterile, off-white, homogenous, opalescent suspension for \nintramuscular injection. TICOVAC is prepared from tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus propagated in chick \nembryo fibroblast (CEF) cells. The harvested virus suspension is inactivated by treatment with formaldehyde, \npurified by sucrose gradient centrifugation and adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide. TICOVAC is available in a \n0.5 mL adult presentation and a 0.25 mL pediatric presentation.  \n \nEach 0.5 mL dose is formulated to contain 2.4 microgram (µg) TBE inactivated virus, 0.5 mg human serum \nalbumin, 0.35 mg aluminum hydroxide, 3.45 mg sodium chloride, 0.22 mg dibasic sodium phosphate, and \n0.045 mg of monobasic potassium phosphate. From the manufacturing process, each 0.5 mL may also contain \nformaldehyde (≤5 µg), sucrose (≤15 mg), protamine sulfate (≤0.5 µg), and trace amounts of chick protein and \nDNA from CEF cells, neomycin and gentamicin. The 0.25 mL dose of TICOVAC contains the same \ncomponents as the 0.5 mL dose in half of the quantities. \n \nTICOVAC is formulated without preservatives. \n \n9 \n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n \n12.1 Mechanism of Action \n \nFollowing administration, TICOVAC induces TBEV-neutralizing antibodies, which are believed to confer \nprotection. However, a protective antibody level has not been defined.  \n \n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \n \nTICOVAC has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity, genotoxicity or impairment of \nfertility. \n \n14 CLINICAL STUDIES \n \n14.1 Immunogenicity \n \nPrimary Immunization Course \n \nThe immunogenicity of TICOVAC described in this section is based on results from the following studies: \n• Study 209: Healthy subjects 1 through 15 years of age TBE seronegative at baseline received three \nvaccinations with TICOVAC. The first two vaccinations were given 1 month apart followed by the third \nvaccination 6 months after the first vaccination. \n• Study 213: Healthy subjects 16 to 64 years of age TBE seronegative at baseline who had received two \nvaccinations in Study 208 given one month apart, received a third vaccination with TICOVAC 6 months \nafter the first vaccination in Study 208. \n• Study 690601: Healthy subjects 16 years of age and older TBE seronegative at baseline received three \nvaccinations with TICOVAC. The first two vaccinations were given 14 days apart followed by the third \nvaccination 6 months after the first vaccination.   \n \nTable 6 shows neutralization test (NT) seropositivity rates 21 days after the third vaccination in subjects 1 \nthrough 15 years of age vaccinated with TICOVAC in Study 209.  \n \nTable 6: Seropositivity Rates (NT)a by Age Group; Post Dose 3b (Study 209) \nAge Group \n% (n/N) \n(95% CI)c \n1-5 Years \n99.2% (125/126) \n(95.7%, 100.0%) \n6-15 Years \n99.6% (240/241) \n(97.7%, 100.0%) \nTotal \n99.5% (365/367) \n(98.0%, 99.9%) \nAbbreviations: CI=confidence interval; NT=neutralization test. \nClinical trial identifier: NCT00161863. \na. \nSeropositivity was defined as NT ≥1:10 (Neudoerfl TBE strain). \nb. \nEvaluated 21 days after Dose 3. \nc. \nExact 2-sided CI calculated using the Clopper and Pearson method. \n \nTable 7 shows NT seropositivity rates 21 days after the third vaccination in subjects 16 years of age and older \nvaccinated with TICOVAC in Study 690601 and Study 213. \n \n10 \nTable 7: \nSeropositivity Rates (NT)a by Age Group; Post Dose 3b \nTICOVAC (Studies 213 and 690601) \nAge Group \n(Study Number) \n% (n/N) \n(95% CI)c \n16-64 Years (Study 213) \n98.8% (411/416) \n(97.2%, 99.6%) \n16-49 Years (Study 690601) \n100.0% (144/144) \n(97.5%, 100.0%) \n≥50 Years (Study 690601) \n98.7% (151/153) \n(95.4%, 99.8%) \nAbbreviations: CI=confidence interval; NT=neutralization test.  \nClinical trial identifiers: NCT00161876 and NCT00460486. \na. \nSeropositivity was defined as NT ≥1:10 (Neudoerfl TBE strain). \nb. \nEvaluated 21 days after Dose 3. \nc. \nExact 2-sided CI calculated using the Clopper and Pearson method. \n \nSeven days after the third vaccination, 90.6% of the subjects 16 years of age and older were seropositive (Study \n690601). \n \nSeropersistence and Booster Vaccination \n \nTwo open-label, multi-center, follow-up studies which enrolled subjects who were seropositive 1 month after the \nthird vaccination from Studies 213 (N=252, ages 16 through 65 at the time of first TICOVAC dose) and 209 \n(N=358, ages 1 through 15 at the time of first TICOVAC dose) were conducted to assess the seropersistence of \nTBE antibodies after completion of the primary vaccination series and the antibody response to a booster \nadministration. Three years after the primary series of TICOVAC , NT seropositivity in follow-up studies 223 \nand 700401 ranged from 82.9% to 100% depending on age. Following a booster dose the NT seropositivity rates \nwere 100%. \n \n14.2 Field Vaccine Effectiveness \n \nIn Austria, field effectiveness of TBE vaccines was assessed retrospectively for the period from 2000 to 2011. \nDuring this period, two TBE vaccines were available in Austria. The market coverage in Austria for TICOVAC \nwas 95%, 90%, and 80%, in 2000, 2006, and 2011, respectively.1 The calculation of TBE vaccine effectiveness \noverall is based on (1) the annual numbers of serologically confirmed cases of TBE virus infections with \nneurological symptoms causing hospitalization (2) their vaccination history, and (3) the proportion of \nvaccinated and unvaccinated in the Austrian population. During the study period, the recommended vaccination \nschedule in Austria consisted of 2 vaccinations approximately 4 weeks apart followed by a third vaccination 5-\n12 months after the second dose, and a booster vaccination ≥3 years after the third dose. The TBE cases were \ncategorized based on their vaccination status. Among the 883 TBE cases in Austria between 2000 and 2011, 45 \npatients did not have an accurate vaccination history. The best-case and worst-case estimates of vaccine \neffectiveness were calculated. For the best-case estimate, the 45 patients without an accurate vaccination history \nwere excluded from the calculation. For the worst-case estimate, these 45 patients were assumed to have been \nvaccinated according to the recommended schedule. The proportions of vaccinated and unvaccinated \nindividuals in the general population were estimated using annual postal surveys sent to 4,000 households \n(8,500–10,000 household members). Overall, worst-case and best-case TBE vaccine effectiveness for \npreventing hospitalized TBE was estimated to be 96.3% (95% CI: 95.5, 97.0) and 98.7% (95% CI: 98.2, 99.0), \nrespectively, following at least 3 doses of TBE vaccine administered according to the recommended schedule in \nAustria.2  \n \n15 \nREFERENCES \n \n1. \nHeinz FX, Holzmann H, Essl A, et al.

[See Drug Interactions (7.2).] \n5.6 \nSyncope  \nSyncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines \nincluding Quadracel. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n243 – Quadracel® \n \n4 \nIn a clinical study, the most common solicited injection site reactions were pain (>75%), \nincrease in arm circumference (>65%), erythema (>55%), and swelling (>40%). \nCommon solicited systemic reactions were myalgia (>50%), malaise (>35%), and \nheadache (>15%). \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction \nrates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in \nthe clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nThe adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for \nidentifying the adverse events that appear to be related to vaccine use and for \napproximating rates of those events. \nIn a randomized, controlled, multicenter study conducted in the US and Puerto Rico \n(Study M5I02; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01346293), 3,372 children, 4 to 6 years \nof age, who had received 4 doses of DAPTACEL and/or Pentacel vaccine(s) received \nQuadracel, or DAPTACEL + IPOL (Poliovirus Vaccine Inactivated) vaccines \nadministered concomitantly but at separate sites. Subjects also received Measles, \nMumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live (MMR) (Merck & Co., Inc.) and Varicella Virus \nVaccine Live (Varicella vaccine) (Merck & Co., Inc.) administered concomitantly at \nseparate sites. Safety was evaluated in 2,733 subjects who received Quadracel and \n621 subjects who received DAPTACEL + IPOL vaccines. \nAmong these subjects, 51.5% were male, 48.5% were female, 75.7% were Caucasian, \n8.6% were Black, 7.9% were Hispanic, 0.9% were Asian, and 7.8% were of other \nracial/ethnic groups. The mean age for both groups was 4.4 years and the ratio of male \nto female subjects and ethnicity were balanced between both groups. \nSolicited injection site reactions and systemic reactions were collected daily for 7 days \nfollowing vaccination, via diary cards. Participants were monitored for unsolicited \nadverse events for 28 days and serious adverse events (SAEs) for 6 months after \nvaccination.  \nSolicited Adverse Reactions \nThe incidence and severity of solicited injection site and systemic adverse reactions that \noccurred within 7 days after vaccination in each study group are shown in Table 1. \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n243 – Quadracel® \n \n5 \nTable 1: Percentage of Children 4 through 6 years of Age with Solicited Adverse \nReactions by Intensity Within 7 Days of Vaccination with Quadracel or \nConcomitant but Separate DAPTACEL and IPOL vaccines Co-Administered with \nMMR and Varicella Vaccines*  \n \nQuadracel \n(N†= 2,500-2,689) \nDAPTACEL + IPOL \n(N† = 598-603) \nInjection Site Reactions \nQuadracel site \nDAPTACEL or IPOL site \nPain,Any  \n77.4 \n76.5 \nPain‡, Grade 1 \n56.4 \n54.9 \nPain‡, Grade 2 \n19.0 \n18.6 \nPain‡, Grade 3 \n2.0 \n3.0 \nChange in limb circumference§, \nAny  \n68.1 \n65.1 \nChange in limb circumference§, \nGrade 1 \n59.8 \n58.6 \nChange in limb circumference§, \nGrade 2 \n8.2 \n6.5 \nChange in limb circumference§, \nGrade 3 \n0.2 \n0.0 \nErythema, Any \n59.1 \n53.4 \nErythema, >0 to <25 mm \n31.6 \n31.8 \nErythema, ≥25 to <50 mm \n9.5 \n9.6 \nErythema, ≥50 mm \n18.0 \n11.9 \nSwelling, Any \n40.2 \n36.4 \nSwelling, >0 to <25 mm \n23.5 \n23.1 \nSwelling, ≥25 to <50 mm \n8.1 \n6.1 \nSwelling, ≥50 mm \n8.6 \n7.1 \nExtensive limb swelling, Any \n1.5 \n1.3 \nSystemic Reactions \n \n \nMyalgia#, Any  \n53.8 \n52.6 \nMyalgia#, Grade 1 \n36.0 \n33.5 \nMyalgia#, Grade 2 \n15.8 \n16.3 \nMyalgia#, Grade 3 \n1.9 \n2.8 \nMalaise#, Any  \n35.0 \n33.2 \nMalaise#, Grade 1 \n21.7 \n18.7 \nMalaise#, Grade 2 \n10.6 \n11.1 \nMalaise#, Grade 3 \n2.6 \n3.3 \nHeadache#, Any  \n15.6 \n16.6 \nHeadache#, Grade 1 \n11.9 \n11.9 \nHeadache#, Grade 2 \n3.1 \n4.0 \nHeadache#, Grade 3 \n0.6 \n0.7 \nFever, Any  \n6.0 \n6.9 \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n243 – Quadracel® \n \n6 \n \nQuadracel \n(N†= 2,500-2,689) \nDAPTACEL + IPOL \n(N† = 598-603) \nFever ≥38.0°C to ≤38.4°C \n2.6 \n3.0 \nFever, ≥38.5°C to ≤38.9°C \n2.1 \n1.8 \nFever, ≥39.0°C \n1.3 \n2.0 \n*  ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01346293. \n†  N = The number of subjects with available data. \n‡  Grade 1: Easily tolerated, Grade 2: Sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal behavior or \nactivities, Grade 3: Incapacitating, unable to perform usual activities. \n§  Grade 1: >0 to <25 mm increase over pre-vaccination measurement, Grade 2: ≥25 to ≤50 mm increase \nover pre-vaccination measurement, Grade 3: >50 mm increase over pre-vaccination measurement.  \n¶  Swelling of the injected limb including the adjacent joint (i.e., elbow and/or shoulder) as compared to \nbaseline. \n#  Grade 1: No interference with activity, Grade 2: Some interference with activity, Grade 3: Significant; \nprevents daily activity. \nSerious Adverse Events \nIn Study M5I02, within 28 days following vaccination with Quadracel, or DAPTACEL + \nIPOL vaccines, and concomitant MMR and varicella vaccines, 0.1% of subjects \n(3/2,733) in the Quadracel group experienced a serious adverse event. During the same \ntime period, 0.2% subjects (1/621) in the DAPTACEL + IPOL group experienced a SAE. \nWithin the 6-month follow-up period after vaccination, SAEs were reported in 0.8% of \nsubjects (21/2,733) who received Quadracel and 0.5% of subjects (3/621) who received \nDAPTACEL + IPOL vaccines, none of which were assessed as related to vaccination.  \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience  \nThe following adverse events have been spontaneously reported, during the post-\nmarketing use of Quadracel outside the US, in infants and children from 2 months \nthrough 6 years of age. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population \nof uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a \ncausal relationship to vaccine exposure. This list includes adverse events based on one \nor more of the following factors: severity, frequency of reporting, or strength of evidence \nfor a causal relationship to Quadracel. \n• Immune system disorders  \nAnaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity and allergic reactions (such as rash, \nurticaria, dyspnea) \n• Psychiatric disorders \nScreaming \n• Nervous system disorders \nSomnolence, convulsion, febrile convulsion, HHE, hypotonia \n• Cardiac disorders \nCyanosis  \n• Vascular disorders \nPallor \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n243 – Quadracel® \n \n7 \n• General disorders and administration site conditions  \nListlessness \nInjection site reactions (including inflammation, mass, sterile abscess, and \nedema) \nLarge injection site reactions (>50 mm), including limb swelling which may extend \nfrom the injection site beyond one or both joints \n• Infections and Infestations \nInjection site cellulitis, injection site abscess \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 \nConcomitant Administration with Other Vaccines  \nIn the US clinical trial, Study M5I02, Quadracel was administered concomitantly with \none or more of the following US-licensed vaccines: MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine. \n[See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] \nWhen Quadracel is given at the same time as another injectable vaccine(s), the \nvaccines should be administered with different syringes and at different injection sites. \n7.2 \nImmunosuppressive Treatments  \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, \ncytotoxic drugs and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may \nreduce the immune response to Quadracel. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5).]  \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nThe safety and effectiveness of Quadracel has not been established in children less \nthan 4 years of age or children 7 through 16 years of age and is not approved for use in \nthese age groups. \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nQuadracel (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed and \nInactivated Poliovirus Vaccine) is a sterile suspension for intramuscular injection.  \nEach 0.5 mL dose is formulated to contain 15 Lf diphtheria toxoid, 5 Lf tetanus toxoid, \nacellular pertussis antigens [20 mcg detoxified pertussis toxin (PT), 20 mcg filamentous \nhemagglutinin (FHA), 3 mcg pertactin (PRN), 5 mcg fimbriae types 2 and 3 (FIM)], and \ninactivated polioviruses [40 D-antigen units (DU) Type 1 (Mahoney), 8 DU Type 2 \n(MEF-1), 32 DU Type 3 (Saukett)]. \nCorynebacterium diphtheriae is grown in modified Mueller’s growth medium. (1) After \npurification by ammonium sulfate fractionation, the diphtheria toxin is detoxified with \nformaldehyde and diafiltered.  \nClostridium tetani is grown in modified Mueller-Miller casamino acid medium without \nbeef heart infusion. (2) Tetanus toxin is detoxified with formaldehyde and purified by \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n243 – Quadracel® \n \n8 \nammonium sulfate fractionation and diafiltration. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are \nindividually adsorbed onto aluminum phosphate. \nThe acellular pertussis vaccine antigens are produced from Bordetella pertussis \ncultures grown in Stainer-Scholte medium (3) modified by the addition of casamino \nacids and dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin. PT, FHA and PRN are isolated separately from \nthe supernatant culture medium. FIM are extracted and copurified from the bacterial \ncells. The pertussis antigens are purified by sequential filtration, salt-precipitation, \nultrafiltration and chromatography. PT is detoxified with glutaraldehyde. FHA is treated \nwith formaldehyde and the residual aldehydes are removed by ultrafiltration. The \nindividual antigens are adsorbed separately onto aluminum phosphate. \nPoliovirus Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 are each grown in separate cultures of MRC-5 \ncells, a line of normal human diploid cells, by the microcarrier method. (4) (5) The cells \nare grown in CMRL (Connaught Medical Research Laboratories) 1969 medium, \nsupplemented with calf serum. For viral growth, the culture medium is replaced by \nMedium 199, without calf serum. After clarification and filtration, the viral suspensions \nare concentrated by ultrafiltration, and purified by liquid chromatography steps. The \nmonovalent viral suspensions are inactivated with formaldehyde. Monovalent \nconcentrates of each inactivated poliovirus are combined to produce a trivalent \npoliovirus concentrate.  \nThe adsorbed diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis antigens are combined with \naluminum phosphate, 2-phenoxyethanol (not as a preservative) and water for injection, \ninto an intermediate concentrate. The trivalent poliovirus concentrate is added and the \nvaccine is diluted to its final concentration.  \nEach 0.5 mL dose contains 1.5 mg aluminum phosphate (0.33 mg aluminum) as the \nadjuvant, polysorbate 80 (approximately 10 ppm by calculation), <2 mcg residual \nformaldehyde, <50 ng residual glutaraldehyde, ≤50 ng residual bovine serum albumin, \n3.3 mg (0.6% v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol (not as a preservative), <4 pg of neomycin and <4 \npg polymyxin B sulfate.  \nQuadracel does not contain a preservative. \nBoth diphtheria and tetanus toxoids induce at least 2 neutralizing units per mL in the \nguinea pig potency test. The potency of the acellular pertussis antigens is evaluated by \nthe antibody response of immunized mice to detoxified PT, FHA, PRN and FIM as \nmeasured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The potency of the \ninactivated poliovirus antigens is determined by measuring antibody-mediated \nneutralization of poliovirus in sera from immunized rats. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 Mechanism of Action  \nDiphtheria  \nDiphtheria is an acute toxin-mediated disease caused by toxigenic strains of C. \ndiphtheriae. Protection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing \nantibodies to diphtheria toxin. A serum diphtheria antitoxin level of 0.01 IU/mL is the \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n243 – Quadracel® \n \n9 \nlowest level giving some degree of protection. Antitoxin levels of at least 0.1 IU/mL are \ngenerally regarded as protective. (6) Levels of 1.0 IU/mL have been associated with \nlong-term protection. (7) \nTetanus \nTetanus is an acute disease caused by an extremely potent neurotoxin produced by C. \ntetani. Protection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to \ntetanus toxin.  A serum tetanus antitoxin level of at least 0.01 IU/mL, measured by \nneutralization assay, is considered the minimum protective level. (6) (8). A tetanus \nantitoxoid level ≥0.1 IU/mL as measured by the ELISA used in clinical studies of \nQuadracel is considered protective.  \nPertussis \nPertussis (whooping cough) is a respiratory disease caused by B. pertussis. This Gram-\nnegative coccobacillus produces a variety of biologically active components, though \ntheir role in either the pathogenesis of, or immunity to, pertussis has not been clearly \ndefined.  \nThere is no well-established serological correlate of protection for pertussis. Because \nDAPTACEL contains the same pertussis antigens manufactured by the same process \nas those in Quadracel, the effectiveness of Quadracel against pertussis was based on a \ncomparison of pertussis immune responses following Quadracel to those following \nDAPTACEL (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine \nAdsorbed). [See Clinical Studies (14)]. The efficacy of the pertussis component of \nDAPTACEL was determined in clinical trials of DAPTACEL administered to infants (see \nDAPTACEL prescribing information). Quadracel contains twice as much detoxified PT \nand four times as much FHA as DAPTACEL. Quadracel contains the same quantity of \nthe same pertussis antigens manufactured by the same process as those in Pentacel \nand VAXELIS.  \nPoliomyelitis \nPolioviruses, of which there are three serotypes (Types 1, 2, and 3), are enteroviruses. \nThe presence of poliovirus type-specific neutralizing antibodies has been correlated with \nprotection against poliomyelitis. (9) \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nQuadracel has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or \nimpairment of fertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \n14.1 Immunogenicity  \nIn Study M5I02, children 4 through 6 years of age received Quadracel or DAPTACEL + \nIPOL as the fifth dose in the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccination series and \nthe fourth or fifth dose in the inactivated poliovirus vaccination series. Subjects also \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n243 – Quadracel® \n \n10 \nreceived their second dose of MMR and Varicella vaccines, concomitantly. The \nimmunogenicity subset comprised 263 subjects in the Quadracel group and 253 \nsubjects in the DAPTACEL + IPOL vaccines group. [See study description in Adverse \nReactions (6.1)].  \nAntibody levels to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (PT, FHA, PRN and FIM) and poliovirus \nantigens were measured in sera obtained immediately prior to vaccination and 28 days \nafter vaccination. The co-primary endpoints were booster response rates and antibody \ngeometric mean concentrations/titers (GMCs/GMTs) to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis \nand poliovirus antigens elicited after vaccination. Booster response rates and antibody \nGMCs/GMTs following Quadracel vaccination were compared to those after \nDAPTACEL + IPOL vaccination.  \nQuadracel was non-inferior to DAPTACEL + IPOL vaccines administered concomitantly \nat separate sites, as demonstrated by comparison of the post-vaccination antibody \nbooster response rates and GMCs/GMTs to diphtheria and tetanus (Table 2), to all \npertussis antigens (Table 3) and to poliovirus 1, 2 and 3 (Table 4). \nTable 2: Booster Response Rates, Pre- and Post-Vaccination Seroprotection \nRates and Post-Vaccination Antibody Levels to Diphtheria and Tetanus Antigens \nFollowing Quadracel or Concomitant but Separate DAPTACEL and IPOL Vaccines \nCo-Administered with MMR and Varicella Vaccines*  \n \nQuadracel \n(N† =253-262) \nDAPTACEL + IPOL \n(N† =248-253) \nAnti-Diphtheria \n \n \n% Booster Response‡ \n97.3§ \n99.2 \nPre-vaccination % ≥0.1 IU/mL¶  \n90.7 \n83.1 \nPost-vaccination % ≥0.1 IU/mL¶  \n100.0 \n99.6 \nPost-vaccination % ≥1.0 IU/mL¶  \n99.6 \n99.6 \nPost-vaccination GMC (IU/mL) \n18.6# \n15.5 \nAnti-Tetanus \n \n \n% Booster Response‡ \n84.2§ \n84.3 \nPre-vaccination % ≥0.1 IU/mL¶ \n91.7 \n89.1 \nPost-vaccination % ≥0.1 IU/mL¶  \n100.0 \n99.2 \nPost-vaccination % ≥1.0 IU/mL¶  \n98.9 \n96.8 \nPost-vaccination GMC (IU/mL) \n6.4# \n5.5 \n*  ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01346293. \n†  N = The number of subjects with available data. \n‡  Booster response: In subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentrations <0.1 IU/mL, a post-\nvaccination level ≥0.4 IU/mL;

The vaccine contains sorbitol and gelatin as a stabilizer, is lyophilized, and is \nhermetically sealed under nitrogen. No preservative is added. Each vial of vaccine is supplied \nwith a separate vial of sterile diluent, which contains Sodium Chloride Injection USP – without a \npreservative. YF-VAX is formulated to contain not less than 4.74 log10 plaque forming units \n(PFU) per 0.5 mL dose throughout the life of the product. Before reconstitution, YF-VAX is a \npinkish color. After reconstitution, YF-VAX is a slight pink-brown suspension. \nThe vial stoppers for YF-VAX and diluent are not made with natural rubber latex. \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \nYellow fever is an acute viral illness caused by a mosquito-borne flavivirus. Most yellow fever \nvirus infections are asymptomatic. In those individuals who develop disease, the clinical \nspectrum ranges from nonspecific flu-like illness with fever, malaise, prostration, headache, \nphotophobia, generalized arthralgia and myalgia, nausea, and/or vomiting to potentially lethal \npansystemic disease, most prominently involving the liver, kidneys, GI tract, and brain, with \nrecrudescing fever, jaundice, renal failure, severe hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia, and \nshock. (1) The case-fatality rate of yellow fever varies widely in different studies but is typically \n20% or higher. Jaundice or other gross evidence of severe liver disease is associated with higher \nmortality rates.  \nTwo live, attenuated yellow fever vaccines, strains 17D-204 and 17DD, were derived in parallel \nin the 1930s. Historical data suggest that these “17D vaccines” have identical safety and \nimmunogenicity profiles. Vaccination with 17D strain vaccines is predicted to elicit an immune \nresponse identical in quality to that induced by wild-type infection. This response is presumed to \nresult from initial infection of cells in the dermis or other subcutaneous tissues near the injection \nsite, with subsequent replication and limited spread of virus leading to the processing and \npresentation of viral antigens to the immune system, as would occur during infection with wild-\ntype yellow fever virus. The humoral immune response to the viral structural proteins, as \nopposed to a cell-mediated response, is most important in the protective effect induced by 17D \nvaccines. Yellow fever antibodies with specificities that prevent or abort infection of cells are \ndetected as neutralizing antibodies in assays that measure the ability of serum to reduce plaque \nformation in tissue culture cells. The titer of virus neutralizing antibodies in sera of vaccinees is a \nsurrogate for efficacy. A log10 neutralization index (LNI, measured by a plaque reduction assay) \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nof 0.7 or greater was shown to protect 90% of monkeys from lethal intracerebral challenge. (2) \nThis is the definition of seroconversion adopted for clinical trials of yellow fever vaccine. The \nstandard has also been adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) for efficacy of yellow \nfever vaccines in humans. (3)  \nIn 24 uncontrolled studies conducted world-wide between 1962 and 1997 evaluating neutralizing \nantibody responses to 17D vaccines among a total of 2,529 adults and 991 infants and children, \nthe seroconversion rate was greater than 91% in all but two studies and never lower than 81%. \nThere were no significant age-related differences in immunogenicity. (1) \nFive of these 24 studies were conducted in the US between 1962 and 1993 and included 208 \nadults who received YF-VAX. The seroconversion rate was 81% in one study involving 32 \nsubjects and 97% to 100% in the other four studies. (1) (4) (5) (6) (7)  \nIn 2001, YF-VAX was used as a control in a double-blind, randomized comparison trial with \nanother 17D-204 vaccine, conducted at nine centers in the US. YF-VAX was administered to \n725 adults ≥18 years old with a mean age of 38 years. Three hundred twelve of these subjects \nwho received YF-VAX were evaluated serologically, and 99.3% of them seroconverted with a \nmean LNI of 2.21. The LNI was slightly higher among males compared to females and slightly \nlower among Hispanic and African-American subjects compared to others, but these differences \nwere not associated with differences in protective effect of the vaccine. There was no difference \nin mean LNI for subjects <40 years old compared to subjects ≥40 years old. Due to the small \nnumber of subjects (1.7%) with prior flavivirus immunity, it was not possible to draw \nconclusions about the role of this factor in the immune response. (8)  \nFor most healthy individuals, a single dose of yellow fever vaccine provides long-lasting \nprotection. (9) (10) In controlled studies where the immune response to vaccination was \nevaluated, the small percentage of immunologically normal individuals who failed to develop an \nimmune response to an initial vaccination typically did so upon re-vaccination. (11)  \nIn two separate clinical trials of 17D-204 vaccines, 90% of subjects seroconverted within 10 \ndays after vaccination, (12) and 100% of subjects seroconverted within 14 days. (1) Thus, \nInternational Health regulations stipulate that the vaccination certificate for yellow fever is valid \n10 days after administration of YF-VAX. (13)  \nINDICATIONS AND USAGE  \nYF-VAX is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of yellow fever in persons 9 \nmonths of age and older in the following categories: \nPersons Living in or Traveling to Endemic Areas  \nWhile the actual risk for contracting yellow fever during travel is probably low, variability of \nitineraries, behaviors and seasonal incidence of disease make it difficult to predict the actual risk \nfor a given individual living in or traveling to a known endemic or epidemic area. Greater risk is \nassociated with living in or traveling to areas of South America and Africa where yellow fever \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \ninfection is officially reported at the time of travel and with traveling outside the urban areas of \ncountries that do not officially report the disease but that lie in a yellow fever endemic zone. \nPersons Traveling Internationally Through Countries with Yellow Fever  \nSome countries require an individual to have a valid International Certificate of Vaccination or \nProphylaxis (ICVP) if the individual has been in countries either known or thought to harbor \nyellow fever virus. The certificate becomes valid 10 days after vaccination with YF-VAX. (13) \n(14)  \nLaboratory Personnel  \nLaboratory personnel who handle virulent yellow fever virus or concentrated preparations of the \nyellow fever vaccine virus strains may be at risk of exposure by direct or indirect contact or by \naerosols. (14) \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \nHypersensitivity  \nYF-VAX is contraindicated in anyone with a history of acute hypersensitivity reaction to any \ncomponent of the vaccine. (See DESCRIPTION section.) Because the yellow fever virus used \nin the production of this vaccine is propagated in chicken embryos, do not administer YF-VAX \nto anyone with a history of acute hypersensitivity to eggs or egg products due to a risk of \nanaphylaxis. Less severe or localized manifestations of allergy to eggs or to feathers are not \ncontraindications to vaccine administration and do not usually warrant vaccine skin testing. (See \nPRECAUTIONS section, Testing for Hypersensitivity Reactions subsection.) Generally, \npersons who are able to eat eggs or egg products may receive the vaccine. (14) (15) \nIndividuals Less Than 9 Months of Age  \nVaccination with YF-VAX is contraindicated in infants less than 9 months of age due to an \nincreased risk of encephalitis. \nVaccination with YF-VAX is also contraindicated in lactating women who are providing \nbreastmilk to infants less than 9 months of age due to the potential for transmission of vaccine \nvirus in breastmilk. (See PRECAUTIONS section, Nursing Mothers subsection.) \nImmunosuppressed Individuals  \nVaccination with YF-VAX, a live virus vaccine, is contraindicated in individuals with severe \nimmunosuppression, including for example, those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, \nleukemia, lymphoma, thymic disease, generalized malignancy, and patients who are undergoing \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \ndrug therapy (e.g., systemic corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites or other \nimmunomodulatory drugs) or radiation therapy. Thymic disorders associated with abnormal \nimmune cell function (e.g., myasthenia gravis, thymoma) may be an independent risk factor for \nthe development of yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease. (See WARNINGS \nsection.) (16)  \nDo not administer YF-VAX to individuals with severe immunosuppression.  \nFamily members of immunosuppressed persons, who themselves have no contraindications, may \nreceive YF-VAX. (14) (17) \nWARNINGS  \nSevere Allergic Reactions  \nSevere allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) may occur following the use of YF-VAX, even in \nindividuals with no prior history of hypersensitivity to the vaccine components. Appropriate \nmedical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions \nfollowing administration of the vaccine. \nYellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease  \nAge greater than 60 years is a risk factor for yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic \ndisease (YEL-AVD) (14) which may present as non-specific multi-organ system failure or can \nbe similar to fulminant yellow fever caused by wild-type yellow fever virus, with liver failure \nand internal bleeding, leading to death. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS section.) Available \nevidence suggests that the occurrence of this syndrome may depend upon undefined host factors, \nrather than intrinsic virulence of the yellow fever strain 17D vaccine, based on characterization \nof vaccine viruses isolated from individuals with YEL-AVD. YEL-AVD has been reported to \noccur only after the first dose of yellow fever vaccine; there have been no reports of YEL-AVD \nfollowing booster dose. (17) The decision to vaccinate individuals 60 years of age and older \nneeds to weigh the risks and benefits of vaccination and the risk for exposure to yellow fever \nvirus. (18) (19) (20) (21) \nYellow fever vaccine-associated neurotropic disease  \nAge greater than 60 years and immunosuppression are risk factors for post-vaccinal encephalitis, \nalso known as yellow fever vaccine-associated neurotropic disease (YEL-AND). (See \nADVERSE REACTIONS section.) Almost all cases of YEL-AND have been in first-time \nvaccine recipients. (17) The decision to vaccinate individuals 60 years of age and older and \nimmunosuppressed individuals needs to weigh the risks and benefits of vaccination and the risk \nfor exposure to yellow fever virus. \nPRECAUTIONS  \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nGeneral  \nVaccination with YF-VAX may not protect 100% of individuals.  \nDo not administer YF-VAX by intravascular, intramuscular, or intradermal routes. \nUse a separate, sterile syringe and needle for each patient to prevent transmission of blood borne \ninfectious agents. Do not recap needles. Dispose of needles and syringes according to biohazard \nwaste guidelines. \nTesting for Hypersensitivity Reactions  \nDo not administer YF-VAX to an individual with a history of hypersensitivity to egg or chicken \nprotein. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS section.) However, if an individual is suspected of \nbeing an egg-sensitive individual, the following test can be performed before the vaccine is \nadministered: \n1. Scratch, prick, or puncture test: Place a drop of a 1:10 dilution of the vaccine in physiologic \nsaline on a superficial scratch, prick, or puncture on the volar surface of the forearm. Positive \n(histamine) and negative (physiologic saline) controls should also be used. The test is read after \n15 to 20 minutes. A positive test is a wheal (superficial bump) 3 mm larger than that of the saline \ncontrol, usually with surrounding erythema. The histamine control must be positive for valid \ninterpretation. If the result of this test is negative, an intradermal (ID) test should be performed. \n2. Intradermal test: Inject a dose of 0.02 mL of a 1:100 dilution of the vaccine in physiologic \nsaline. Positive and negative control skin tests should be performed concurrently. A wheal 5 mm \nor larger than the negative control with surrounding erythema is considered a positive reaction. \nIf vaccination is considered essential despite a positive skin test, consider desensitization. (See \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section, Desensitization subsection.) \nSyncope  \nSyncope can occur following or even before vaccination. Procedures should be in place to \nprevent falling and injury and to manage syncope.  \nInformation for Patients \nPrior to administration of YF-VAX, ask potential vaccinees or their parents or guardians about \ntheir recent health status and history of yellow fever vaccination. Inform potential vaccinees or \ntheir parents or guardians about the benefits and risks of immunization and potential for adverse \nreactions to YF-VAX administration. Instruct vaccinees or their parents or guardians to report to \ntheir health-care providers all serious adverse events that occur up to 30 days post-vaccination. \nAll travelers should seek information regarding vaccination requirements by consulting with \ntheir health care providers. Such requirements may be strictly enforced for entry into certain \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \ncountries, particularly for persons traveling from Africa or South America to Asia. Additional \ninformation is available from local health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC), and WHO. Travel agencies, international airlines, and/or shipping lines may \nalso have up-to-date information. The vaccination center should complete, sign, and stamp an \nInternational Certificate of Vaccination and provide the certificate to the vaccinee. The \nimmunization record should contain the date, lot number and manufacturer of the vaccine \nadministered. Inform vaccinees that vaccination certificates are valid commencing 10 days after \nvaccination. (14) \nDrug Interactions  \nData are limited in regard to the interaction of YF-VAX with other vaccines. \n• Measles (Schwartz strain) vaccine, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole cell pertussis \nvaccine (DTP), (22) Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B vaccines, (5) (14) (23) (24) meningococcal \nvaccine, Menomune®A/C/Y/W-135, and typhoid vaccine, Typhim Vi®, (5) (14) (23) have \nbeen administered with yellow fever vaccine at separate injection sites. \n• The potential for interference between yellow fever vaccine and rabies or Japanese \nencephalitis vaccines has not been established. (14)  \n• In a prospective study, persons given 5 cc of commercially available immune globulin did \nnot experience alterations in immunologic responses to the yellow fever vaccine. (14) (25) \n(26) \n• Although chloroquine inhibits replication of yellow fever vaccine in vitro, it does not appear \nto adversely affect antibody responses to yellow fever vaccine among persons receiving \nchloroquine. (14) (27) \nPatients on Corticosteroid Therapy  \nOral Prednisone or other systemic corticosteroid therapy, depending on dose and duration of \nexposure, may have an immunosuppressive effect on recipients of yellow fever vaccine that \npotentially decreases immunogenicity and increases the risk of adverse events. Intra-articular, \nbursal, or tendon injections with corticosteroids should not constitute an increased hazard to \nrecipients of yellow fever vaccine. \nPatients with Asymptomatic Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection  \nThe rate of seroconversion following YF-VAX is reduced in individuals with asymptomatic HIV \ninfection and appears to depend on HIV viral load and CD4 + T-cell count. (14) Therefore, \ndocumentation of a protective antibody response is recommended before travel. (See \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section.) For discussion of this subject and for \ndocumentation of the immune response to vaccine where it is deemed essential, contact the CDC \nat 1-970-221-6400. \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nYF-VAX has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or its effect on \nfertility. \nPregnancy  \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with YF-VAX. It is also not known \nwhether YF-VAX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect \nreproduction capacity. YF-VAX should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. \nYF-VAX has not been evaluated in pregnant women. However, based on experience of other \nyellow fever vaccines, the following findings have been determined for safety and effectiveness. \nA case-control study of Brazilian women found no significant difference in the odds ratio of \nspontaneous abortion among vaccinated women compared to a similar unvaccinated group. (28) \nIn a separate study in Trinidad, 100 to 200 pregnant females were immunized, no adverse events \nrelated to pregnancy were reported. In addition, 41 cord blood samples were obtained from \ninfants born to mothers immunized during the first trimester. One of these infants tested positive \nfor IgM antibodies in cord blood. The infant appeared normal at delivery, and no subsequent \nadverse sequelae of infection were reported. However, this result suggests that transplacental \ninfection with 17D vaccine viruses can occur. (29) In another study involving 101 Nigerian \nwomen, the majority of whom (88%) were in the third trimester of pregnancy, none of the 40 \ninfants who were delivered in a hospital tested positive for IgM antibodies as a criterion for \ntransplacental infection with vaccine virus. However, the percentage of pregnant women who \nseroconverted was reduced compared to a non-pregnant control group (38.6% vs. 81.5%). (30)  \nFor further discussion of vaccination with YF-VAX during pregnancy and for documentation of \na protective immune response to vaccine where it is deemed essential, contact the CDC at 1-970-\n221-6400. \nNursing Mothers  \nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from YF-VAX, a \ndecision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or not to administer the vaccine, taking \ninto account the importance of the vaccine to the mother. As of July, 2015, three vaccine-\nassociated neurotropic disease cases have been reported worldwide in exclusively breastfed \ninfants whose mothers were vaccinated with yellow fever vaccines, including one case reported \nafter vaccination with YF-VAX. All three infants were diagnosed with encephalitis and were less \nthan one month of age at the time of exposure. (17) Because age less than 9 months is a risk \nfactor for yellow fever vaccine-associated neurotropic disease, YF-VAX is contraindicated in \nlactating women who are providing breastmilk to infants younger than 9 months of age. (See \nCONTRAINDICATIONS section.) Discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with lactating \nwomen who are providing breastmilk to infants 9 months of age and older. (14) \nPediatric Use  \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nVaccination of infants less than 9 months of age is contraindicated because of the risk of yellow \nfever vaccine-associated neurotropic disease. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and ADVERSE \nREACTIONS sections.) \nGeriatric Use  \nThere is an increased risk of severe systemic adverse reactions to YF-VAX in individuals 60 \nyears of age and older. Monitor elderly individuals for signs and symptoms of yellow fever \nvaccine-associated viscerotropic disease, which typically occurs within 10 days post-vaccination. \n(See WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections.) (16) (31)  \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \nData from Clinical Studies  \nAdverse reactions to YF-VAX include mild headaches, myalgia, low-grade fevers, or other \nminor symptoms for 5 to 10 days. Local reactions including edema, hypersensitivity, pain or \nmass at the injection site have also been reported following yellow fever vaccine administration. \nImmediate hypersensitivity reactions, characterized by rash, urticaria, and/or asthma, occur \nprincipally among persons with histories of allergy to eggs or other substances contained in the \nvaccine. \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nNo placebo-controlled trial has assessed the safety of YF-VAX. However, between 1953 and \n1994, reactogenicity of 17D-204 vaccine was monitored in 10 uncontrolled clinical trials. The \ntrials included a total of 3,933 adults and 264 infants greater than 4 months old residing in \nEurope or in yellow fever endemic areas. Self-limited and mild local reactions consisting of \nerythema and pain at the injection site and systemic reactions consisting of headache and/or fever \noccurred in a minority of subjects (typically less than 5%) 5 to 7 days after immunization. In one \nstudy involving 115 infants age 4 to 24 months the incidence of fever was as high as 21%. Also \nin this study, reactogenicity of the vaccine was markedly reduced among a subset of subjects \nwho had serological evidence of previous exposure to yellow fever virus. Only two of the ten \nstudies provided diary cards for daily reporting; this method resulted in a slightly higher \nincidence of local and systemic complaints. YF-VAX was used as a control in a double-blind, \nrandomized comparative trial with another 17D-204 vaccine, conducted at nine centers in the \nUS. YF-VAX was administered to 725 adults ≥18 years old with a mean age of 38 years. Safety \ndata were collected by diary card for days 1 through 10 after vaccination and by interview on \ndays 5, 11, and 31. Among subjects who received YF-VAX, there were no serious adverse \nevents, and 71.9% experienced non-serious adverse events judged to have been related to \nvaccination. Most of these were injection site reactions of mild to moderate severity. Four such \nlocal reactions were considered severe. Rash occurred in 3.2%, including two subjects with \nurticaria. Systemic reactions (headache, myalgia, malaise, and asthenia) were usually mild and \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \noccurred in 10% to 30% of subjects during the first few days after vaccination. The incidence of \nnon-serious adverse reactions, including headache, malaise, injection site edema, and pain, was \nsignificantly lower in subjects >60 years compared to younger subjects. Adverse events were less \nfrequent in the 1.7% of vaccinated subjects who had pre-existing immunity to yellow fever virus, \ncompared to those without pre-existing immunity. (8)  \nData from Post-marketing Experience  \nThe following additional adverse events have been spontaneously reported during the post-\nmarketing use of YF-VAX worldwide. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a \npopulation of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a \ncausal relationship to vaccine exposure. This list includes adverse events based on one or more \nof the following factors: severity, frequency of reporting, or strength of evidence for a causal \nrelationship to YF-VAX. \n• General disorders and administration site conditions  \n• Injection-site blisters  \n• Immune System Disorders (14) \nImmediate hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis, characterized by rash and/or urticaria \nand/or respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, bronchospasm, or pharyngeal edema) occur \nprincipally among persons with histories of allergies to egg or other substances contained in \nthe vaccine. \n• Nervous System Disorders (1) (32) (33) (34) \nIsolated cases of Yellow Fever Vaccine-Associated Neurotropic Disease (YEL-AND), \nsometimes fatal, have been reported to occur within 30 days following vaccination with YF-\nVAX, and other yellow fever vaccines. (See WARNINGS section, Yellow fever vaccine-\nassociated neurotropic disease subsection.) Age less than 9 months and congenital or \nacquired immunodeficiency have been identified as risk factors for this event. (See \nWARNINGS and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections.) Twenty-one cases of YEL-AND \nassociated with all licensed 17D vaccines have been reported between 1952 and 2004. \nEighteen of these cases were in children or adolescents. Fifteen of these cases occurred prior \nto 1960, thirteen of which occurred in infants 4 months of age or younger, and two of which \noccurred in infants six and seven months old. The incidence of vaccine-associated \nneurologic disease in infants less than 4 months old is estimated to be between 50 and 400 \ncases per 1,000,000, based on two historical reports where denominators are available. (33) \n(34) (35) A study in Senegal (34) described two fatal cases of encephalitis possibly \nassociated with 17D-204 vaccination among 67,325 children between the ages of 6 months \nand 2 years, for an incidence rate of 3 per 100,000. The incidence of YEL-AND in the \nUnited States is less than 1:100,000 doses administered. (17) \nOther neurological complications have included Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), acute \ndisseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and bulbar palsy. \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n• Infections and infestations \nIsolated cases of Yellow Fever Vaccine-Associated Viscerotropic Disease YEL-AVD, \nformerly described as “Febrile Multiple Organ-System-Failure”, sometimes fatal, have been \nreported following YF-VAX and other yellow fever vaccines. (See WARNINGS section, \nYellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease subsection.) In the majority of cases \nreported, the onset of signs and symptoms was within 10 days after the vaccination. Initial \nsigns and symptoms are non-specific and may include pyrexia, myalgia, fatigue and \nheadache, potentially progressing quickly to liver and muscle cytolysis and possibly to \nthrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and acute renal failure. (18) The pathophysiological \nmechanism of such reactions has not been established. In some individuals with YEL-AVD \na medical history of thymic disease has been reported. (36) Age older than 60 has also been \nidentified as a risk factor for this event. (9) During surveillance in the U.S. between 1996 \nand 1998, four individuals (ages 63, 67, 76, and 79) became severely ill 2 to 5 days after \nvaccination with YF-VAX vaccine. Three of these 4 subjects died. The incidence rate for \nthese serious adverse events was estimated at 1 per 400,000 doses of YF-VAX vaccine, \nbased on the total number of doses administered in the U.S. civilian population during the \nsurveillance period. (21) YEL-AVD has occurred after yellow fever vaccination in fewer \nthan 1:100,000 U.S. vaccinees, (14) most commonly in individuals 60 years of age and \nolder.  \nIn a CDC analysis of data submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) \nbetween 1990 and 1998, the rate of systemic adverse events following vaccination was 2.5-fold \nhigher in the 65 years or older age group (6.2 events per 100,000 doses of vaccine) compared to \nthe 25 to 44 year-old age group (2.5 events per 100,000 doses of vaccine). (31) \nReporting of Adverse Events  \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact the Pharmacovigilance Department, \nSanofi Pasteur Inc., Discovery Drive, Swiftwater, PA 18370 at 1-800-822-2463 (1-800-\nVACCINE) or VAERS at 1-800-822-7967 or https://vaers.hhs.gov. \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  \nPrimary Vaccination: Administer a single subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mL of reconstituted \nvaccine. \nAdditional Dosing Information: \nA single dose of yellow fever vaccine provides long-lasting protection to most healthy \nindividuals. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section.) However, an additional dose of \nyellow fever vaccine may be given to individuals who might not have had an adequate or \nsustained immune response to prior yellow fever vaccination and who continue to be at risk for \nexposure to yellow fever virus. Such individuals include women who were vaccinated during \npregnancy, hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, and HIV-infected persons. \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nBooster Vaccination: A booster dose may be given to individuals who were last vaccinated \nagainst yellow fever at least 10 years prior and who are at increased risk for yellow fever disease \neither because of location and duration of travel or because of more consistent exposure to \nvirulent virus. Such individuals include travelers who plan to spend a prolonged period in \nendemic areas or who plan to travel to highly endemic areas such as rural West Africa, and \nlaboratory personnel who handle virulent yellow fever virus or concentrated preparations of the \nyellow fever vaccine virus strains. (10)  \nSome countries may require for entry evidence of a valid yellow fever vaccination (i.e., ICVP) \nwithin the previous 10 years for certain individuals, depending on prior travel itinerary. A \nbooster dose of YF-VAX may be given to satisfy this requirement. (10) (37)  \nConcomitant Administration with other Vaccines  \nLimited data are available related to administration of YF-VAX with other vaccines and the \npotential for immune interference. (See PRECAUTIONS section, Drug Interactions \nsubsection.) In instances where vaccines are given concomitantly, administer injections using \nseparate syringes at separate sites. Do not combine or mix YF-VAX with any other vaccine. \nWhen not administered concomitantly, wait at least 4 weeks between administration of YF-VAX \nand other live vaccines. (14) \nVaccine Preparation  \nYF-VAX is supplied as two separate vials: a lyophilized powder (Vial 1) to be reconstituted with \nthe diluent, Sodium Chloride Injection USP (Vial 2). A single dose, after reconstitution, is 0.5 \nmL. \n• Reconstitute the vaccine using only the diluent supplied (0.6 mL single dose vial of Sodium \nChloride Injection USP for single dose vial of vaccine). After removing the \"flip-off\" caps, \ncleanse the vaccine and diluent vial stoppers with a suitable germicide. Do not remove the \nvial stoppers or metal seals holding them in place. Using aseptic technique, use a suitable \nsterile needle and syringe to withdraw the volume of supplied diluent shown on the diluent \nlabel and slowly inject the diluent into the vial containing the vaccine. Allow the \nreconstituted vaccine to sit for one to two minutes and then carefully swirl mixture until a \nuniform suspension is achieved. Avoid vigorous shaking as this tends to cause foaming of the \nsuspension. Do not dilute reconstituted vaccine. Use aseptic technique and a separate sterile \nneedle and syringe to withdraw each 0.5 mL dose from the single dose vial of reconstituted \nvaccine. \n• Before reconstitution, YF-VAX is a pinkish color. After reconstitution, YF-VAX is a slight \npink-brown suspension. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate \nmatter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If \neither of these conditions exists, do not administer the vaccine. \n• Administer the single dose of 0.5 mL subcutaneously using a suitable sterile needle.  \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \n• Use YF-VAX within 60 minutes of reconstituting the single dose vial. \n• Discard unused portion. \nProperly dispose of all reconstituted vaccine and containers that remain unused after one hour \naccording to locally approved guidelines (e.g. sterilized or disposed in red hazardous waste \ncontainers). (14) \nDesensitization  \nIf immunization is imperative and the individual has a history of severe egg sensitivity and has a \npositive skin test to the vaccine, this desensitization procedure may be used to administer the \nvaccine.  \nThe following successive doses should be administered subcutaneously at 15 to 20 minute \nintervals: \n1. 0.05 mL of 1:10 dilution  \n2. 0.05 mL of full strength  \n3. 0.10 mL of full strength \n4. 0.15 mL of full strength \n5. 0.20 mL of full strength \nDesensitization should only be performed under the direct supervision of a physician \nexperienced in the management of anaphylaxis with necessary emergency equipment \nimmediately available.  \nHOW SUPPLIED  \nYF-VAX is supplied as a two-vial presentation in separate cartons as follows:    \n \nCarton \nCarton NDC Number \nVial NDC Number \nCarton of 5 single-dose vials of Yellow \nFever Vaccine YF-VAX  (lyophilized \npowder; Vial 1) \n49281-915-01 \n49281-915-58 \nCarton of 5 single-dose vials of \nSodium Chloride Injection USP \n(diluent; Vial 2) \n49281-912-05 \n49281-912-59 \n \nThe vial stoppers for YF-VAX vaccine and diluent are not made with natural rubber latex. \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \n \n \nSTORAGE  \nStore at 2° to 8°C (35° to 46°F). DO NOT FREEZE.  \nDo not use vaccine after expiration date. YF-VAX does not contain a preservative.  \nThe following stability information for YF-VAX is provided for those countries or areas of the \nworld where an adequate cold chain is a problem and inadvertent exposure to abnormal \ntemperatures has occurred. Half-life is reduced from approximately 14 days at 35° to 37°C to 3-\n4.5 days at 45° to 47°C. \nYF-VAX (Yellow Fever Vaccine) in the US is supplied only to designated Yellow Fever Vaccination \nCenters authorized to issue certificates of Yellow Fever Vaccination. Location of  \nthe nearest Yellow Fever Vaccination Centers may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control  \nand Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, state or local health departments. \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \nREFERENCES   \n1 \nMonath TP et al.

However, between 1953 and 1994, reactogenicity of 17D-204 vaccine was monitored in 10 uncontrolled clinical trials. The trials included a total of 3,933 adults and 264 infants greater than 4 months old residing in Europe or in yellow fever endemic areas. Self-limited and mild local reactions consisting of erythema and pain at the injection site and systemic reactions consisting of headache and/or fever occurred in a minority of subjects (typically less than 5%) 5 to 7 days after immunization. YF-VAX was used as a control in a double-blind, randomized comparative trial with another 17D-204 vaccine, conducted at nine centers in the US. YF-VAX was administered to 725 adults ≥18 years old with a mean age of 38 years. Safety data were collected by diary card for days 1 through 10 after vaccination and by interview on days 5, 11, and 31. Among subjects who received YF-VAX, there were no serious adverse events, and 71.9% experienced non-serious adverse events judged to have been related to vaccination. Most of these were injection site reactions of mild to moderate severity. Four such local reactions were considered severe. Rash occurred in 3.2%, including two subjects with urticaria.

Do not use if resuspension \ndoes not occur with vigorous shaking. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for \nparticulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container \npermit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered. \nAttach a sterile needle and administer intramuscularly. \nDo not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously. \n2.2 \nRecommended Dose and Schedule  \nKINRIX is to be administered as a 0.5-mL dose by intramuscular injection. The preferred site of \nadministration is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. \nKINRIX may be used for the fifth dose in the DTaP immunization series and the fourth dose in \nthe IPV immunization series in children aged 4 through 6 years (prior to the seventh birthday) \nwhose previous DTaP vaccine doses have been with INFANRIX and/or PEDIARIX for the first \n3 doses and INFANRIX for the fourth dose [see Indications and Usage (1)]. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nKINRIX is a suspension for injection available in 0.5-mL single-dose prefilled TIP-LOK \nsyringes. \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity  \nSevere allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any diphtheria toxoid-, \ntetanus toxoid-, pertussis- or poliovirus-containing vaccine, or to any component of KINRIX, \nincluding neomycin and polymyxin B, is a contraindication to administration of KINRIX [see \nDescription (11)]. Because of the uncertainty as to which component of the vaccine might be \nresponsible, no further vaccination with any of these components should be given. Alternatively, \nsuch individuals may be referred to an allergist for evaluation if immunization with any of these \ncomponents is considered. \n4.2 \nEncephalopathy  \nEncephalopathy (e.g., coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) within 7 days \nof administration of a previous dose of a pertussis-containing vaccine that is not attributable to \nanother identifiable cause is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing \nvaccine, including KINRIX. \n \n3\n4.3 \nProgressive Neurologic Disorder  \nProgressive neurologic disorder, including infantile spasms, uncontrolled epilepsy, or \nprogressive encephalopathy, is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing \nvaccine, including KINRIX. Pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with \nsuch conditions until a treatment regimen has been established and the condition has stabilized. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nGuillain-Barré Syndrome  \nIf Guillain-Barré syndrome occurs within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus \ntoxoid, the decision to give any tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, including KINRIX, should be \nbased on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks. When a decision is \nmade to withhold tetanus toxoid, other available vaccines should be given, as indicated. \n5.2 \nSyncope  \nSyncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including \nKINRIX. Syncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual \ndisturbance, paresthesia, and tonic-clonic limb movements. Procedures should be in place to \navoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope. \n5.3 \nAdverse Reactions following Prior Pertussis Vaccination  \nIf any of the following reactions occur in temporal relation to receipt of a pertussis-containing \nvaccine, the decision to give any pertussis-containing vaccine, including KINRIX, should be \nbased on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks: \n• Temperature of 40.5oC (105oF) within 48 hours not due to another identifiable cause; \n• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours; \n• Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours; \n• Seizures with or without fever occurring within 3 days. \nWhen a decision is made to withhold pertussis vaccination, other available vaccines should be \ngiven, as indicated. \n5.4 \nChildren at Risk for Seizures  \nFor children at higher risk for seizures than the general population, an appropriate antipyretic \nmay be administered at the time of vaccination with a pertussis-containing vaccine, including \nKINRIX, and for the ensuing 24 hours to reduce the possibility of post-vaccination fever. \n5.5 \nPreventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions  \nPrior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the patient’s immunization history \nfor possible vaccine sensitivity and previous vaccination-related adverse reactions to allow an \nassessment of benefits and risks. Epinephrine and other appropriate agents used for the control of \nimmediate allergic reactions must be immediately available should an acute anaphylactic \n \n4\nreaction occur. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nA total of 4,013 children were vaccinated with a single dose of KINRIX in 4 clinical trials. Of \nthese, 381 children received a non-U.S. formulation of KINRIX (containing 2.5 mg \n2-phenoxyethanol per dose as preservative). \nThe primary study (Study 048), conducted in the United States, was a randomized, controlled \nclinical trial in which children aged 4 to 6 years were vaccinated with KINRIX (n = 3,156) or \ncontrol vaccines (INFANRIX and IPOL vaccine [IPV, Sanofi Pasteur SA]; n = 1,053) as a fifth \nDTaP vaccine dose following 4 doses of INFANRIX and as a fourth IPV dose following 3 doses \nof IPOL. Subjects also received the second dose of U.S.-licensed measles, mumps, and rubella \n(MMR) vaccine (Merck & Co., Inc.) administered concomitantly, at separate sites. \nData on adverse events were collected by parents/guardians using standardized forms for 4 \nconsecutive days following vaccination with KINRIX or control vaccines (i.e., day of \nvaccination and the next 3 days). The reported frequencies of solicited local reactions and \ngeneral adverse reactions in Study 048 are presented in Table 1. \nIn 3 studies (Studies 046, 047, and 048), children were monitored for unsolicited adverse events, \nincluding serious adverse events that occurred in the 31-day period following vaccination, and in \n2 studies (Studies 047 and 048), parents/guardians were actively queried about changes in the \nchild’s health status, including the occurrence of serious adverse events, through 6 months post-\nvaccination. \n \n5\nTable 1.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily \nfrom a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency \nor establish a causal relationship to vaccination. \nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \nInjection site vesicles. \nNervous System Disorders \nSyncope. \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \nPruritus. \nAdditional adverse reactions reported following postmarketing use of INFANRIX, for which a \ncausal relationship to vaccination is plausible, are: Allergic reactions, including anaphylactoid \nreactions, anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria; apnea; collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-\nhyporesponsive episode); convulsions (with or without fever); lymphadenopathy; and \nthrombocytopenia. \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 \nConcomitant Vaccine Administration  \nIn U.S. clinical trials, KINRIX was administered concomitantly with the second dose of MMR \nvaccine (Merck & Co., Inc.); in one of these trials (Study 055), KINRIX was also administered \nconcomitantly with varicella vaccine (Merck & Co., Inc.) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. \n \n7\nWhen KINRIX is administered concomitantly with other injectable vaccines, they should be \ngiven with separate syringes. KINRIX should not be mixed with any other vaccine in the same \nsyringe. \n7.2 \nImmunosuppressive Therapies  \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic \ndrugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune \nresponse to KINRIX. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nSafety and effectiveness of KINRIX in children younger than 4 years and children aged 7 to \n16 years have not been evaluated. KINRIX is not approved for use in persons in these age \ngroups. \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nKINRIX (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed and Inactivated \nPoliovirus Vaccine) is a noninfectious, sterile vaccine for intramuscular administration. Each \n0.5-mL dose is formulated to contain 25 Lf of diphtheria toxoid, 10 Lf of tetanus toxoid, 25 mcg \nof inactivated pertussis toxin (PT), 25 mcg of filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), 8 mcg of \npertactin (69 kiloDalton outer membrane protein), 40 D-antigen Units (DU) of Type 1 poliovirus \n(Mahoney), 8 DU of Type 2 poliovirus (MEF-1), and 32 DU of Type 3 poliovirus (Saukett). The \ndiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis components of KINRIX are the same as those in INFANRIX \nand PEDIARIX and the poliovirus component is the same as that in PEDIARIX. \nThe diphtheria toxin is produced by growing Corynebacterium diphtheriae (C. diphtheriae) in \nFenton medium containing a bovine extract. Tetanus toxin is produced by growing Clostridium \ntetani (C. tetani) in a modified Latham medium derived from bovine casein. The bovine \nmaterials used in these extracts are sourced from countries which the United States Department \nof Agriculture (USDA) has determined neither have nor are at risk of bovine spongiform \nencephalopathy (BSE). Both toxins are detoxified with formaldehyde, concentrated by \nultrafiltration, and purified by precipitation, dialysis, and sterile filtration. \nThe acellular pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, and pertactin) are isolated from Bordetella pertussis \n(B. pertussis) culture grown in modified Stainer-Scholte liquid medium. PT and FHA are \nisolated from the fermentation broth; pertactin is extracted from the cells by heat treatment and \nflocculation. The antigens are purified in successive chromatographic and precipitation steps. PT \nis detoxified using glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde. FHA and pertactin are treated with \nformaldehyde. \nDiphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis antigens (inactivated PT, FHA, and pertactin) are \nindividually adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide. \n \n8\nThe inactivated poliovirus component of KINRIX is an enhanced potency component. Each of \nthe 3 strains of poliovirus is individually grown in VERO cells, a continuous line of monkey \nkidney cells, cultivated on microcarriers. Calf serum and lactalbumin hydrolysate are used during \nVERO cell culture and/or virus culture. Calf serum is sourced from countries the USDA has \ndetermined neither have nor are at risk of BSE. After clarification, each viral suspension is \npurified by ultrafiltration, diafiltration, and successive chromatographic steps, and inactivated \nwith formaldehyde. The 3 purified viral strains are then pooled to form a trivalent concentrate. \nDiphtheria and tetanus toxoid potency is determined by measuring the amount of neutralizing \nantitoxin in previously immunized guinea pigs. The potency of the acellular pertussis \ncomponents (inactivated PT, FHA, and pertactin) is determined by enzyme-linked \nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) on sera from previously immunized mice. The potency of the \ninactivated poliovirus component is determined by using the D-antigen ELISA and by a \npoliovirus-neutralizing cell culture assay on sera from previously immunized rats. \nEach 0.5-mL dose contains aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant (formulated to contain 0.5 mg \naluminum) and ≤4.4 mg of sodium chloride. The aluminum content is measured by assay. Each \ndose also contains 100 mcg of residual formaldehyde and 100 mcg of polysorbate 80 (Tween \n80). Neomycin sulfate and polymyxin B sulfate are used in the poliovirus vaccine manufacturing \nprocess and may be present in the final vaccine at 0.05 ng neomycin and 0.01 ng polymyxin B \nper dose. \nThe tip cap and rubber plunger stopper of the prefilled syringe are not made with natural rubber \nlatex. \nKINRIX does not contain a preservative. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action  \nDiphtheria \nDiphtheria is an acute toxin-mediated infectious disease caused by toxigenic strains of C. \ndiphtheriae. Protection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to the \ndiphtheria toxin. A serum diphtheria antitoxin level of 0.01 IU/mL is the lowest level giving \nsome degree of protection; a level of 0.1 IU/mL is regarded as protective.1 \nTetanus \nTetanus is an acute toxin-mediated disease caused by a potent exotoxin released by C. tetani. \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to the tetanus \ntoxin. A serum tetanus antitoxin level of at least 0.01 IU/mL, measured by neutralization assays, \nis considered the minimum protective level.2,3 A level of 0.1 IU/mL is considered protective.4 \n \n9\nPertussis \nPertussis (whooping cough) is a disease of the respiratory tract caused by B. pertussis. The role \nof the different components produced by B. pertussis in either the pathogenesis of, or the \nimmunity to, pertussis is not well understood. There is no well-established serological correlate \nof protection for pertussis. The efficacy of the pertussis component of KINRIX was determined \nin clinical trials of INFANRIX administered as a 3-dose series in infants (see INFANRIX \nprescribing information). \nPoliomyelitis \nPoliovirus is an enterovirus that belongs to the picornavirus family. Three serotypes of poliovirus \nhave been identified (Types 1, 2, and 3). Neutralizing antibodies against the 3 poliovirus \nserotypes are recognized as conferring protection against poliomyelitis disease.5 \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nKINRIX has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or for impairment of \nfertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \n14.1 \nImmunological Evaluation  \nIn a U.S. multicenter study (Study 048), 4,209 children were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive \neither KINRIX or INFANRIX and IPV (Sanofi Pasteur SA) administered concomitantly at \nseparate sites. Subjects also received MMR vaccine (Merck & Co., Inc.) administered \nconcomitantly at a separate site. Subjects were children aged 4 through 6 years who previously \nreceived 4 doses of INFANRIX, 3 doses of IPV, and 1 dose of MMR vaccine. Among subjects in \nboth vaccine groups combined, 49.6% were female; 45.6% of subjects were White, 18.8% \nHispanic, 13.6% Asian, 7.0% Black, and 15.0% were of other racial/ethnic groups. \nLevels of antibodies to the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (PT, FHA, and pertactin), and poliovirus \nantigens were measured in sera obtained immediately prior to vaccination and 1 month (range: \n31 to 48 days) after vaccination (Table 2). The co-primary immunogenicity endpoints were anti-\ndiphtheria toxoid, anti-tetanus toxoid, anti-PT, anti-FHA, and anti-pertactin booster responses, \nand anti-poliovirus Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) 1 month \nafter vaccination. KINRIX was shown to be non-inferior to INFANRIX and IPV administered \nseparately, in terms of booster responses to DTaP antigens and post-vaccination GMTs for anti-\npoliovirus antibodies (Table 2). \n \n10\nTable 2.

Do not inject intravascularly or intramuscularly. \n2.1 \nRecommended Dose and Schedule  \nAdminister ZOSTAVAX as a single 0.65-mL dose subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the upper \narm. \n2.2 \nPreparation for Administration \nUse only sterile syringes free of preservatives, antiseptics, and detergents for each injection and/or \nreconstitution of ZOSTAVAX. Preservatives, antiseptics and detergents may inactivate the vaccine virus. \nZOSTAVAX should be stored refrigerated and should be reconstituted immediately upon removal from \nthe refrigerator. The diluent should be stored separately at room temperature or in the refrigerator. \nWhen reconstituted, ZOSTAVAX is a semi-hazy to translucent, off-white to pale yellow liquid.  \nReconstitution:  \n• \nUse only the diluent supplied.  \n• \nWithdraw the entire contents of the diluent into a syringe.  \n• \nInject all of the diluent in the syringe into the vial of lyophilized vaccine and gently agitate to mix \nthoroughly. \n• \nWithdraw the entire contents of reconstituted vaccine into a syringe and inject the total volume \nsubcutaneously. \n• \nADMINISTER IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECONSTITUTION to minimize loss of potency. \nDiscard reconstituted vaccine if not used within 30 minutes. Do not freeze reconstituted \nvaccine. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \nZOSTAVAX is a lyophilized preparation of live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus (Oka/Merck) to be \nreconstituted with sterile diluent to give a single dose suspension with a minimum of 19,400 PFU (plaque \nforming units) when stored at room temperature for up to 30 minutes. \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity \nDo not administer ZOSTAVAX to individuals with a history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction to \ngelatin, neomycin or any other component of the vaccine. Neomycin allergy manifested as contact \ndermatitis is not a contraindication to receiving this vaccine. {1} \n4.2 \nImmunosuppression  \nDo not administer ZOSTAVAX to individuals who are immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to \ndisease or therapy, as serious or fatal disseminated vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus disease may \noccur. Causes of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression may include, but are not limited to, primary or \nacquired immunodeficiency states, AIDS or other clinical manifestations of infection with human \nimmunodeficiency viruses, leukemia, lymphoma or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow \nor lymphatic system, and immunosuppressive therapy. \n4.3 \nPregnancy  \nDo not administer ZOSTAVAX to pregnant women. Naturally occurring varicella-zoster virus (VZV) \ninfection is known to sometimes cause fetal harm. Pregnancy should be avoided for 3 months following \nadministration of ZOSTAVAX [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Patient Counseling Information \n(17)]. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n5.1 \nHypersensitivity Reactions \nSerious adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred with ZOSTAVAX. Adequate treatment \nprovisions, including epinephrine injection (1:1,000), should be available for immediate use should an \nanaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction occur. \n5.2 \nTransmission of Vaccine Virus \nTransmission of vaccine virus may occur between vaccinees and susceptible contacts. \n \n \n3 \n5.3 \nConcurrent Illness \nDeferral should be considered in acute illness (for example, in the presence of fever) or in patients with \nactive untreated tuberculosis. \n5.4 \nLimitations of Vaccine Effectiveness \nVaccination with ZOSTAVAX does not result in protection of all vaccine recipients.  \nThe duration of protection beyond 4 years after vaccination with ZOSTAVAX is unknown. The need for \nrevaccination has not been defined. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS \nThe most frequent adverse reactions, reported in ≥1% of subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX, were \nheadache and injection-site reactions. \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, rates of adverse reactions \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of \nanother vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.  \nZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) in Subjects 50 to 59 Years of Age \nIn the ZEST study, subjects received a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX (N=11,184) or placebo \n(N=11,212). The racial distribution across both vaccination groups was similar: White (94.4%); Black \n(4.2%); Hispanic (3.3%) and Other (1.4%) in both vaccination groups. The gender distribution was 38% \nmale and 62% female in both vaccination groups. The age distribution of subjects enrolled, 50 to 59 years, \nwas similar in both vaccination groups. All subjects received a vaccination report card (VRC) to record \nadverse events occurring from Days 1 to 42 postvaccination. \nIn the ZEST study, serious adverse events occurred at a similar rate in subjects vaccinated with \nZOSTAVAX (0.6%) or placebo (0.5%) from Days 1 to 42 postvaccination. \nIn the ZEST study, all subjects were monitored for adverse reactions. An anaphylactic reaction was \nreported for one subject vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX. \nMost Common Adverse Reactions and Experiences in the ZEST Study \nThe overall incidence of vaccine-related injection-site adverse reactions within 5 days postvaccination \nwas greater for subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX as compared to subjects who received placebo \n(63.6% for ZOSTAVAX and 14.0% for placebo).

The racial distribution across both vaccination groups was \nsimilar: White (95%); Black (2.0%); Hispanic (1.0%) and Other (1.0%) in both vaccination groups. The \ngender distribution was 59% male and 41% female in both vaccination groups. The age distribution of \nsubjects enrolled, 59-99 years, was similar in both vaccination groups. \nThe Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS, designed to provide detailed data on the safety \nprofile of the zoster vaccine (n=3,345 received ZOSTAVAX and n=3,271 received placebo) used \nvaccination report cards (VRC) to record adverse events occurring from Days 0 to 42 postvaccination \n(97% of subjects completed VRC in both vaccination groups). In addition, monthly surveillance for \nhospitalization was conducted through the end of the study, 2 to 5 years postvaccination. \nThe remainder of subjects in the SPS (n=15,925 received ZOSTAVAX and n=16,005 received \nplacebo) were actively followed for safety outcomes through Day 42 postvaccination and passively \nfollowed for safety after Day 42. \nSerious Adverse Events Occurring 0-42 Days Postvaccination \nIn the overall SPS study population, serious adverse events occurred at a similar rate (1.4%) in \nsubjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX or placebo. \nIn the AE Monitoring Substudy, the rate of SAEs was increased in the group of subjects who received \nZOSTAVAX as compared to the group of subjects who received placebo (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Number of Subjects with ≥1 Serious Adverse Events (0-42 Days Postvaccination) in the \nShingles Prevention Study \n \n \n \nCohort \nZOSTAVAX \nn/N \n% \nPlacebo \nn/N \n% \n \nRelative Risk \n(95% CI) \nOverall Study Cohort \n(60 years of age and older) \n255/18671 \n1.4% \n254/18717 \n1.4% \n1.01  \n(0.85, 1.20) \n60-69 years old \n113/10100 \n1.1% \n101/10095 \n1.0% \n1.12  \n(0.86, 1.46) \n70-79 years old \n115/7351 \n1.6% \n132/7333 \n1.8% \n0.87  \n(0.68, 1.11) \n≥80 years old \n \n27/1220 \n2.2% \n21/1289 \n1.6% \n1.36  \n(0.78, 2.37) \nAE Monitoring Substudy Cohort \n(60 years of age and older) \n64/3326 \n1.9% \n41/3249 \n1.3% \n1.53  \n(1.04, 2.25) \n60-69 years old \n \n22/1726 \n1.3% \n18/1709 \n1.1% \n1.21  \n(0.66, 2.23) \n70-79 years old \n31/1383 \n2.2% \n19/1367 \n1.4% \n1.61  \n(0.92, 2.82) \n≥80 years old \n \n11/217 \n5.1% \n4/173 \n2.3% \n2.19  \n(0.75, 6.45) \nN=number of subjects in cohort with safety follow-up \nn=number of subjects reporting an SAE 0-42 Days postvaccination \n \nAmong reported serious adverse events in the SPS (Days 0 to 42 postvaccination), serious \ncardiovascular events occurred more frequently in subjects who received ZOSTAVAX (20 [0.6%]) than in \nsubjects who received placebo (12 [0.4%]) in the AE Monitoring Substudy. The frequencies of serious \ncardiovascular events were similar in subjects who received ZOSTAVAX (81 [0.4%]) and in subjects who \nreceived placebo (72 [0.4%]) in the entire study cohort (Days 0 to 42 postvaccination). \nSerious Adverse Events Occurring Over the Entire Course of the Study \n \n \n5 \nRates of hospitalization were similar among subjects who received ZOSTAVAX and subjects who \nreceived placebo in the AE Monitoring Substudy, throughout the entire study. \nFifty-one individuals (1.5%) receiving ZOSTAVAX were reported to have congestive heart failure (CHF) \nor pulmonary edema compared to 39 individuals (1.2%) receiving placebo in the AE Monitoring Substudy; \n58 individuals (0.3%) receiving ZOSTAVAX were reported to have congestive heart failure (CHF) or \npulmonary edema compared to 45 (0.2%) individuals receiving placebo in the overall study. \nIn the SPS, all subjects were monitored for vaccine-related SAEs. Investigator-determined, vaccine-\nrelated serious adverse experiences were reported for 2 subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX (asthma \nexacerbation and polymyalgia rheumatica) and 3 subjects who received placebo (Goodpasture’s \nsyndrome, anaphylactic reaction, and polymyalgia rheumatica). \nDeaths \nThe incidence of death was similar in the groups receiving ZOSTAVAX or placebo during the Days 0-\n42 postvaccination period; 14 deaths occurred in the group of subjects who received ZOSTAVAX and 16 \ndeaths occurred in the group of subjects who received placebo. The most common reported cause of \ndeath was cardiovascular disease (10 in the group of subjects who received ZOSTAVAX, 8 in the group of \nsubjects who received placebo). The overall incidence of death occurring at any time during the study was \nsimilar between vaccination groups: 793 deaths (4.1%) occurred in subjects who received ZOSTAVAX \nand 795 deaths (4.1%) in subjects who received placebo. \nMost Common Adverse Reactions and Experiences in the AE Monitoring Substudy of the SPS \nInjection-site adverse reactions reported at an incidence ≥1% are shown in Table 3. Most of these \nadverse reactions were reported as mild in intensity. The overall incidence of vaccine-related injection-site \nadverse reactions was significantly greater for subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX versus subjects who \nreceived placebo (48% for ZOSTAVAX and 17% for placebo). \n \nTable 3: Injection-Site Adverse Reactions* in ≥1% of Adults Who Received ZOSTAVAX or Placebo \nWithin 5 Days Postvaccination from the AE Monitoring Substudy of the Shingles Prevention Study \n \n \n \nAdverse Reaction \nZOSTAVAX \n(N = 3345) \n% \nPlacebo \n(N = 3271) \n% \nSolicited† \nErythema \nPain/Tenderness \nSwelling \n \n35.6 \n34.3 \n26.1 \n \n6.9 \n8.3 \n4.5 \nUnsolicited \nHematoma \nPruritus \nWarmth \n \n1.6 \n6.9 \n1.6 \n \n1.4 \n1.0 \n0.3 \n \n*Patients instructed to report adverse experiences on a Vaccination Report Card \n \n†Solicited on the Vaccination Report Card \n \nHeadache was the only systemic adverse reaction reported on the vaccine report card between Days \n0-42 by ≥1% of subjects in the AE Monitoring Substudy in either vaccination group (ZOSTAVAX 1.4%, \nplacebo 0.8%). \nThe numbers of subjects with elevated temperature (≥38.3ºC [≥101.0ºF]) within 42 days \npostvaccination were similar in the ZOSTAVAX and the placebo vaccination groups [27 (0.8%) vs. 27 \n(0.9%), respectively]. \nThe following adverse experiences in the AE Monitoring Substudy of the SPS (Days 0 to 42 \npostvaccination) were reported at an incidence ≥1% and greater in subjects who received ZOSTAVAX \nthan in subjects who received placebo, respectively: respiratory infection (65 [1.9%] vs. 55 [1.7%]), fever \n(59 [1.8%] vs. 53 [1.6%]), flu syndrome (57 [1.7%] vs. 52 [1.6%]), diarrhea (51 [1.5%] vs. 41 [1.3%]), \nrhinitis (46 [1.4%] vs. 36 [1.1%]), skin disorder (35 [1.1%] vs. 31 [1.0%]), respiratory disorder (35 [1.1%] \nvs. 27 [0.8%]), asthenia (32 [1.0%] vs. 14 [0.4%]).  \n6.2 \nVZV Rashes Following Vaccination \nWithin the 42-day postvaccination reporting period in the ZEST, noninjection-site zoster-like rashes \nwere reported by 34 subjects (19 for ZOSTAVAX and 15 for placebo). Of 24 specimens that were \nadequate for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing, wild-type VZV was detected in 10 (3 for \nZOSTAVAX, 7 for placebo) of these specimens. The Oka/Merck strain of VZV was not detected from any \nof these specimens. Of reported varicella-like rashes (n=124, 69 for ZOSTAVAX and 55 for placebo), 23 \n \n \n6 \nhad specimens that were available and adequate for PCR testing. VZV was detected in one of these \nspecimens in the ZOSTAVAX group; however, the virus strain (wild-type or Oka/Merck strain) could not be \ndetermined. \nWithin the 42-day postvaccination reporting period in the SPS, noninjection-site zoster-like rashes were \nreported by 53 subjects (17 for ZOSTAVAX and 36 for placebo). Of 41 specimens that were adequate for \nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing, wild-type VZV was detected in 25 (5 for ZOSTAVAX, 20 for \nplacebo) of these specimens. The Oka/Merck strain of VZV was not detected from any of these \nspecimens. Of reported varicella-like rashes (n=59), 10 had specimens that were available and adequate \nfor PCR testing. VZV was not detected in any of these specimens. \nIn clinical trials in support of the initial licensure of the frozen formulation of ZOSTAVAX, the reported \nrates of noninjection-site zoster-like and varicella-like rashes within 42 days postvaccination were also low \nin both zoster vaccine and placebo recipients. Of 17 reported varicella-like rashes and non-injection site \nzoster-like rashes, 10 specimens were available and adequate for PCR testing, and 2 subjects \nhad varicella (onset Day 8 and 17) confirmed to be Oka/Merck strain. \n6.3 \nPost-Marketing Experience \nThe following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing use of \nZOSTAVAX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is \ngenerally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the vaccine. \nGastrointestinal disorders: nausea \nInfections and infestations: vaccine strain herpes zoster; disseminated vaccine strain varicella-zoster \nvirus disease including fatal outcomes in immunocompromised patients \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia; myalgia \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: injection-site rash; pyrexia; injection-site urticaria; \ntransient injection-site lymphadenopathy \nImmune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions \nEye Disorders: necrotizing retinitis (patients on immunosuppressive therapy) \nNervous system disorders: Guillain-Barré syndrome; facial paralysis \nReporting Adverse Events \nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established a Vaccine Adverse Event \nReporting System (VAERS) to accept all reports of suspected adverse events after the administration of \nany vaccine.

Consider \nadministration of the two vaccines separated by at least 4 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. \nFor concomitant administration of ZOSTAVAX with inactivated influenza vaccine [see Clinical Studies \n(14.4)]. \n7.2 \nAntiviral Medications \nConcurrent administration of ZOSTAVAX and antiviral medications known to be effective against VZV \nhas not been evaluated. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n8.1 \nPregnancy \nRisk Summary \nZOSTAVAX is contraindicated for use in pregnant women because the vaccine contains live, \nattenuated varicella-zoster virus, and it is known that wild-type varicella-zoster virus, if acquired during \npregnancy, can cause congenital varicella syndrome [see Contraindications (4.3) and Patient Counseling \nInformation (17)]. \nAvailable data on inadvertent administration of ZOSTAVAX to pregnant women are insufficient to \ninform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. \n \n \n7 \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general \npopulation, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized \npregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. \n8.2 \nLactation \nRisk Summary \nIt is not known whether varicella-zoster vaccine virus is excreted in human milk. The developmental \nand health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for \nZOSTAVAX, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ZOSTAVAX or from the \nunderlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility \nto disease prevented by the vaccine. \n8.4 \nPediatric Use \nZOSTAVAX is not indicated for prevention of primary varicella infection (Chickenpox) and should not \nbe used in children and adolescents. \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use \nThe median age of subjects enrolled in the largest (N=38,546) clinical study of ZOSTAVAX was \n69 years (range 59-99 years). Of the 19,270 subjects who received ZOSTAVAX, 10,378 were 60-69 years \nof age, 7,629 were 70-79 years of age, and 1,263 were 80 years of age or older. \n11 \nDESCRIPTION \nZOSTAVAX is a lyophilized preparation of the Oka/Merck strain of live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus \n(VZV). ZOSTAVAX, when reconstituted as directed, is a sterile suspension for subcutaneous \nadministration. Each 0.65-mL dose contains a minimum of 19,400 PFU (plaque-forming units) of \nOka/Merck strain of VZV when reconstituted and stored at room temperature for up to 30 minutes. \nEach dose also contains 41.05 mg of sucrose, 20.53 mg of hydrolyzed porcine gelatin, 8.55 mg of \nurea, 5.25 mg of sodium chloride, 0.82 mg of monosodium L-glutamate, 0.75 mg of sodium phosphate \ndibasic, 0.13 mg of potassium phosphate monobasic, 0.13 mg of potassium chloride; residual \ncomponents of MRC-5 cells including DNA and protein; and trace quantities of neomycin and bovine calf \nserum. The product contains no preservatives. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n12.1 Mechanism of Action \nThe risk of developing zoster appears to be related to a decline in VZV-specific immunity. ZOSTAVAX \nwas shown to boost VZV-specific immunity, which is thought to be the mechanism by which it protects \nagainst zoster and its complications. [See Clinical Studies (14).] \nHerpes zoster (HZ), commonly known as shingles or zoster, is a manifestation of the reactivation of \nvaricella zoster virus (VZV), which, as a primary infection, produces chickenpox (varicella). Following initial \ninfection, the virus remains latent in the dorsal root or cranial sensory ganglia until it reactivates, producing \nzoster. Zoster is characterized by a unilateral, painful, vesicular cutaneous eruption with a dermatomal \ndistribution. \nPain associated with zoster may occur during the prodrome, the acute eruptive phase, and the \npostherpetic phase of the infection. Pain occurring in the postherpetic phase of infection is commonly \nreferred to as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). \nSerious complications, such as PHN, scarring, bacterial superinfection, allodynia, cranial and motor \nneuron palsies, pneumonia, encephalitis, visual impairment, hearing loss, and death can occur as the \nresult of zoster. \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nZOSTAVAX has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or its potential to \nimpair fertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES \nIn two large clinical trials (ZEST and SPS), ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced the risk of developing \nzoster when compared with placebo (see Table 4 and Table 5). \n \n \n8 \n14.1 ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) in Subjects 50 to 59 Years of Age \nEfficacy of ZOSTAVAX was evaluated in the ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST), a placebo-\ncontrolled, double-blind clinical trial in which 22,439 subjects 50 to 59 years of age were randomized to \nreceive a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX (n=11,211) or placebo (n=11,228). Subjects were followed for \nthe development of zoster for a median of 1.3 years (range 0 to 2 years). Confirmed zoster cases were \ndetermined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) [86%] or, in the absence of virus detection, by a Clinical \nEvaluation Committee [14%]. The primary efficacy analysis included all subjects randomized in the study \n(intent-to-treat [ITT] analysis). \nCompared with placebo, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced the risk of developing zoster by 69.8% (95% \nCI: 54.1, 80.6%) in subjects 50 to 59 years of age (Table 4). \n \nTable 4: Efficacy of ZOSTAVAX on HZ Incidence Compared with Placebo in the ZOSTAVAX \nEfficacy and Safety Trial* \n \n \n \nZOSTAVAX \n \nPlacebo \n \nAge group \n(yrs.) \n# subjects \n# HZ \ncases \nIncidence \nrate of HZ \nper 1000 \nperson-yrs. \n# subjects \n# HZ \ncases \nIncidence \nrate of HZ \nper 1000 \nperson-yrs. \nVaccine Efficacy \n(95% CI) \n \n \n50-59 \n \n11211 \n \n30 \n \n1.994 \n \n11228 \n \n99 \n \n6.596 \n \n69.8% (54.1%, 80.6%) \n \n*The analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population that included all subjects randomized in the ZEST study. \n \nImmune responses to vaccination were evaluated in a random 10% subcohort (n=1,136 for \nZOSTAVAX and n=1,133 for placebo) of the subjects enrolled in the ZEST study. VZV antibody levels \n(Geometric Mean Titers, GMT), as measured by glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \n(gpELISA) 6 weeks postvaccination, were increased 2.3-fold (95% CI: 2.2, 2.4) in the group of subjects \nwho received ZOSTAVAX compared to subjects who received placebo; the specific antibody level that \ncorrelates with protection from zoster has not been established. \n14.2 Shingles Prevention Study (SPS) in Subjects 60 Years of Age and Older \nEfficacy of ZOSTAVAX was evaluated in the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS), a placebo-controlled, \ndouble-blind clinical trial in which 38,546 subjects 60 years of age or older were randomized to receive a \nsingle dose of either ZOSTAVAX (n=19,270) or placebo (n=19,276). Subjects were followed for the \ndevelopment of zoster for a median of 3.1 years (range 31 days to 4.90 years). The study excluded people \nwho were immunocompromised or using corticosteroids on a regular basis, anyone with a previous history \nof HZ, and those with conditions that might interfere with study evaluations, including people with cognitive \nimpairment, severe hearing loss, those who were non-ambulatory, and those whose survival was not \nconsidered to be at least 5 years. Randomization was stratified by age, 60-69 and ≥70 years of age. \nSuspected zoster cases were confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) [93%], viral culture [1%], or \nin the absence of virus detection, as determined by a Clinical Evaluation Committee [6%]. Individuals in \nboth vaccination groups who developed zoster were given famciclovir, and, as necessary, pain \nmedications. The primary efficacy analysis included all subjects randomized in the study who were \nfollowed for at least 30 days postvaccination and did not develop an evaluable case of HZ within the first \n30 days postvaccination (Modified Intent-To-Treat [MITT] analysis). \nZOSTAVAX significantly reduced the risk of developing zoster when compared with placebo (Table 5). \nIn the SPS, vaccine efficacy for the prevention of HZ was highest for those subjects 60-69 years of age \nand declined with increasing age. \n \nTable 5: Efficacy of ZOSTAVAX on HZ Incidence Compared with Placebo in the Shingles \nPrevention Study* \n \n \n \nZOSTAVAX \n \nPlacebo \n \nAge group† \n(yrs.) \n# subjects \n# HZ \ncases \nIncidence rate \nof HZ per 1000 \nperson-yrs. \n# subjects \n# HZ \ncases \nIncidence rate \nof HZ per \n1000 person-\nyrs. \nVaccine Efficacy \n(95% CI) \n \n \n \n9 \nOverall \n19254 \n315 \n5.4 \n19247 \n642 \n11.1 \n51% (44%, 58%) \n60-69 \n10370 \n122 \n3.9 \n10356 \n334 \n10.8 \n64% (56%, 71%) \n70-79 \n7621 \n156 \n6.7 \n7559 \n261 \n11.4 \n41% (28%, 52%) \n≥80 \n1263 \n37 \n9.9 \n1332 \n47 \n12.2 \n18% (-29%, 48%) \n * The analysis was performed on the Modified Intent-To-Treat (MITT) population that included all subjects randomized in the study \nwho were followed for at least 30 days postvaccination and did not develop an evaluable case of HZ within the first 30 days \npostvaccination.  \n † Age strata at randomization were 60-69 and ≥70 years of age. \n \nForty-five subjects were excluded from the MITT analysis (16 in the group of subjects who received \nZOSTAVAX and 29 in the group of subjects who received placebo), including 24 subjects with evaluable \nHZ cases that occurred in the first 30 days postvaccination (6 evaluable HZ cases in the group of subjects \nwho received ZOSTAVAX and 18 evaluable HZ cases in the group of subjects who received placebo). \nSuspected HZ cases were followed prospectively for the development of HZ-related complications. \nTable 6 compares the rates of PHN defined as HZ-associated pain (rated as 3 or greater on a 10-point \nscale by the study subject and occurring or persisting at least 90 days) following the onset of rash in \nevaluable cases of HZ. \n \nTable 6: Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN)* in the Shingles Prevention Study† \n \n \n \nZOSTAVAX \n \nPlacebo \n \nAge \ngroup \n(yrs.)‡ \n# \nsubjects \n# HZ \ncases \n# PHN \ncases \nIncidence \nrate of \nPHN per \n1,000 \nperson-\nyrs. \n% HZ \ncases \nwith \nPHN \n# \nsubjects \n# HZ \ncases \n# PHN \ncases \nIncidence \nrate of \nPHN per \n1,000 \nperson-\nyrs. \n% HZ \ncases \nwith \nPHN \nVaccine efficacy \nagainst PHN in \nsubjects who \ndevelop HZ \npostvaccination \n(95% CI) \n \nOverall \n19254 \n315 \n27 \n0.5 \n8.6% \n19247 \n642 \n80 \n1.4 \n12.5% \n39%§  \n(7%, 59%) \n60-69 \n10370 \n122 \n8 \n0.3 \n6.6% \n10356 \n334 \n23 \n0.7 \n6.9% \n5%  \n(-107%, 56%) \n70-79 \n7621 \n156 \n12 \n0.5 \n7.7% \n7559 \n261 \n45 \n2.0 \n17.2% \n55%  \n(18%, 76%) \n≥80 \n1263 \n37 \n7 \n1.9 \n18.9% \n1332 \n47 \n12 \n3.1 \n25.5% \n26%  \n(-69%, 68%) \n * PHN was defined as HZ-associated pain rated as ≥3 (on a 0-10 scale), persisting or appearing more than 90 days after onset \nof HZ rash using Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI). {5} \n † The table is based on the Modified Intent-To-Treat (MITT) population that included all subjects randomized in the study who \nwere followed for at least 30 days postvaccination and did not develop an evaluable case of HZ within the first 30 days \npostvaccination. \n ‡ Age strata at randomization were 60-69 and ≥70 years of age. \n § Age-adjusted estimate based on the age strata (60-69 and ≥70 years of age) at randomization. \n \nThe median duration of clinically significant pain (defined as ≥3 on a 0-10 point scale) among HZ cases \nin the group of subjects who received ZOSTAVAX as compared to the group of subjects who received \nplacebo was 20 days vs. 22 days based on the confirmed HZ cases. \nOverall, the benefit of ZOSTAVAX in the prevention of PHN can be primarily attributed to the effect of \nthe vaccine on the prevention of herpes zoster. Vaccination with ZOSTAVAX in the SPS reduced the \nincidence of PHN in individuals 70 years of age and older who developed zoster postvaccination. Other \nprespecified zoster-related complications were reported less frequently in subjects who received \nZOSTAVAX compared to subjects who received placebo. Among HZ cases, zoster-related complications \nwere reported at similar rates in both vaccination groups (Table 7). \n \nTable 7: Specific complications* of zoster among HZ cases in the Shingles Prevention Study \n \n \nComplication \n \nZOSTAVAX \n(N = 19270) \n \nPlacebo \n(N = 19276) \n \n \n(n = 321) \n \n% Among \nZoster Cases \n(n = 659) \n \n% Among \nZoster Cases \nAllodynia \n135 \n42.1 \n310 \n47.0 \n \n \n10\nBacterial Superinfection \n3 \n0.9 \n7 \n1.1 \nDissemination \n5 \n1.6 \n11 \n1.7 \nImpaired Vision \n2 \n0.6 \n9 \n1.4 \nOphthalmic Zoster \n35 \n10.9 \n69 \n10.5 \nPeripheral Nerve Palsies (motor) \n5 \n1.6 \n12 \n1.8 \nPtosis \n2 \n0.6 \n9 \n1.4 \nScarring \n24 \n7.5 \n57 \n8.6 \nSensory Loss \n7 \n2.2 \n12 \n1.8 \nN=number of subjects randomized \nn=number of zoster cases, including those cases occurring within 30 days postvaccination, with these data available  \n* Complications reported at a frequency of ≥1% in at least one vaccination group among subjects with zoster. \n \nVisceral complications reported by fewer than 1% of subjects with zoster included 3 cases of \npneumonitis and 1 case of hepatitis in the placebo group, and 1 case of meningoencephalitis in the \nvaccine group. \nImmune responses to vaccination were evaluated in a subset of subjects enrolled in the Shingles \nPrevention Study (N=1,395). VZV antibody levels (Geometric Mean Titers, GMT), as measured by \nglycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) 6 weeks postvaccination, were increased \n1.7-fold (95% CI: 1.6 to 1.8) in the group of subjects who received ZOSTAVAX compared to subjects who \nreceived placebo; the specific antibody level that correlates with protection from zoster has not been \nestablished. \n14.3 Long-Term Effectiveness Study in Individuals 50 Years of Age or Older  \nAn interim analysis of a prospective observational cohort study conducted in a US integrated \nhealthcare system database estimated vaccine effectiveness against HZ and PHN among 1,355,720 \nindividuals 50 years of age and older, including 392,677 who received ZOSTAVAX. Age eligible individuals \ncontributed person-time to the unvaccinated group and, once vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX, contributed \nperson-time to the vaccinated group for the remainder of the study. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against HZ \nand PHN was calculated using the incidence rates of protocol-defined first episode of HZ and PHN in the \nvaccinated and unvaccinated groups, including adjustments for calendar time, age, sex, race/ethnicity, \nhealthcare resource utilization, comorbid conditions, and immunocompromise status. The gender and \nracial/ethnic distributions of study individuals were overall 53% female, 60% white, 15% Asian or Pacific \nIslander, 13% Hispanic, and 7% black or African American. \nFor individuals 50-59 years of age at the time of vaccination, the average VE against HZ over the first 3 \nyears following vaccination was 60% (95% CI: 52, 66), with VE against HZ of 36% (95% CI: -55, 73) in the \nthird year post-vaccination. For individuals 60-69 years of age, 70-79 years of age, and 80 years of age \nand older at the time of vaccination, the average VE against HZ over the first 5 years following vaccination \nwas 49% (95% CI: 47, 52), 46% (95% CI: 43, 48), and 44% (95% CI: 38, 49), respectively, with VE against \nHZ of 34% (95% CI: 25, 42), 29% (95% CI: 18, 38), and 36% (95% CI: 12, 53), respectively, in the fifth \nyear post-vaccination. Follow-up time for individuals 50-59 years of age was shorter because ZOSTAVAX \nwas approved for use in this age group five years after approval for use in individuals 60 years of age and \nolder.   \nInsufficient data were available at the time of the interim analysis to assess the outcome of PHN in \nindividuals 50-59 years of age. For individuals 60-69 years of age, 70-79 years of age, and 80 years of \nage and older at the time of vaccination, the average VE against PHN over the first 5 years following \nvaccination was 72% (95% CI: 65, 77), 69% (95% CI: 62, 75), and 61% (95% CI: 47, 71), respectively, \nwith VE against PHN of 61% (95% CI: 33, 77), 69% (95% CI: 44, 82), and 34% (95% CI: -49, 71), \nrespectively, in the fifth year post-vaccination. The benefit of ZOSTAVAX in the prevention of PHN can be \nattributed in part to the effect of the vaccine on the prevention of HZ. \n14.4 Concomitant Use Studies \nIn a double-blind, controlled substudy, 374 adults in the US, 60 years of age and older (median age = \n66 years), were randomized to receive trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and ZOSTAVAX \nconcurrently (N=188), or TIV alone followed 4 weeks later by ZOSTAVAX alone (N=186). The antibody \nresponses to both vaccines at 4 weeks postvaccination were similar in both groups. \nIn another double-blind, controlled study, 882 adults in the US, 50 years of age and older (median \nage = 60 years), were randomized to receive quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and ZOSTAVAX \nconcurrently (N=440), or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine alone followed 4 weeks later by \nZOSTAVAX alone (N=442). The antibody responses to both vaccines at 4 weeks postvaccination were \nsimilar in both groups. \n \n \n11\nIn a double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 473 adults, 60 years of age or older, were randomized to \nreceive ZOSTAVAX and PNEUMOVAX 23 concomitantly (N=237), or PNEUMOVAX 23 alone followed 4 \nweeks later by ZOSTAVAX alone (N=236). At 4 weeks postvaccination, the VZV antibody levels following \nconcomitant use were significantly lower than the VZV antibody levels following nonconcomitant \nadministration (GMTs of 338 vs. 484 gpELISA units/mL, respectively; GMT ratio = 0.70 (95% CI: 0.61, \n0.80). \n15 \nREFERENCES \n1. \nReitschel RL, Bernier R.

If either of these conditions \nexist, do not administer the vaccine. \nAdminister CYFENDUS intramuscularly. \nDo not mix CYFENDUS with any other product in the same syringe or vial. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \nCYFENDUS is a suspension for intramuscular injection. Each dose is 0.5 mL. \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \nDo not administer CYFENDUS to individuals with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., \nanaphylaxis) following a previous dose of CYFENDUS, BioThrax or any component of the \nvaccine [see Description (11)]. \n \n3 \n \n \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n5.1 \nManagement of Acute Allergic Reactions \nAppropriate medical treatment must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions \nfollowing administration of CYFENDUS. \n5.2 \nAltered Immunocompetence \nImmunocompromised persons, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have \na diminished immune response to CYFENDUS.  \n5.3 \nPregnancy  \nCYFENDUS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant individual. In an \nobservational study, there were more birth defects in infants born to individuals vaccinated with \nBioThrax (a licensed anthrax vaccine with the same active ingredient as CYFENDUS; BioThrax \ndoes not contain CPG 7909 adjuvant) in the first trimester compared to infants born to \nindividuals vaccinated post pregnancy or individuals never vaccinated with BioThrax. [See Use \nin Specific Populations (8.1)] \nIf CYFENDUS is administered during pregnancy, the vaccinated individual should be apprised \nof the potential hazard to a fetus.  \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS   \nThe most common (>10%) injection-site adverse reactions reported were tenderness (88.1%), \npain (86.3%), arm motion limitation (63.7%), warmth (51.2%), induration (37.5%), itching \n(21.9%), swelling (19.7%), and erythema/redness (17.9%.). The most common systemic adverse \nreactions (>10%) were muscle aches (75.2%), tiredness (67.1%), and headache (58.0%) (see \nTable 1).  \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. \nThe safety of CYFENDUS was evaluated in 4 clinical studies, in which a total of 3,276 \nparticipants 18 through 65 years of age received at least one dose of CYFENDUS and were \nincluded in a pooled safety population.  \nStudy 1 (NCT01263691) evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of different vaccine \nformulations administered intramuscularly two weeks apart in participants between 18 and 50 \nyears of age. Seventeen participants received at least one 0.5 mL dose of CYFENDUS.  \n4 \n \n \nStudy 2 (NCT01770743) evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of different dosing regimens \nof CYFENDUS in participants between 18 and 50 years of age. Forty-four participants received \ntwo doses of CYFENDUS via the intramuscular route two weeks apart.  \nStudy 3 (NCT04067011) investigated potential interactions of intramuscularly administered \nCYFENDUS with the antibacterials ciprofloxacin or doxycycline, when administered \nconcomitantly in participants between 18 and 45 years of age. Sixty-four participants received \nonly CYFENDUS in the control arm.  \nStudy 4 (NCT03877926) evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of CYFENDUS in \nparticipants between 18 and 65 years of age. CYFENDUS was administered intramuscularly as \ntwo doses at Weeks 0 and 2, with saline placebo given at Week 4. BioThrax was administered \nsubcutaneously as three doses at Weeks 0, 2, and 4. The number of participants receiving at least \none dose of CYFENDUS was 3151, while 2898 participants received the complete two dose \nregimen. [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]  \nThe mean age for the pooled safety population across Studies 1-4 was 39 years; 32.1% of \nparticipants (n=1050) were between 18-30 years of age, 44.2% (n=1447) were between 31 to 50 \nyears of age, and 23.8% (n=779) were between 51-65 years of age. Females comprised 57.8% \n(n=1895) of the population, with 40.4% (n=1325) being women of childbearing potential. The \nrace distribution was as follows: 77.9% White, 17.1% Black or African American, 1.8% Asian, \n1.7% Multiracial, 0.4% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian or Other \nPacific Islander, 0.5% Other, and 0.2% Unknown. Most participants (83.9%) were not Hispanic \nor Latino.  \nStudy 4 Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions \nIn Study 4, an active-controlled study, the licensed anthrax vaccine, BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine \nAdsorbed), was used as the comparator. Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions reported \nfollowing administration of any dose of CYFENDUS or BioThrax are presented in Table 1. \nCYFENDUS was administered intramuscularly as two doses at Weeks 0 and 2, with saline \nplacebo given at Week 4. BioThrax was administered subcutaneously as three doses at Weeks 0, \n2, and 4. The number of participants receiving at least one dose of CYFENDUS was 3151, while \n2898 participants received the complete two dose regimen of CYFENDUS. There was no notable \ndifference in the frequency of solicited local or systemic adverse reactions after the first or \nsecond dose of CYFENDUS, with the exception of itching (10.3% after first CYFENDUS dose \nvs. 16.8% after second dose), erythema/redness (7.4% after first CYFENDUS dose vs. 14.8% \nafter second dose), swelling (10.2% after first CYFENDUS dose vs. 15.9% after second dose and \nfever (2.7% after first CYFENDUS dose vs. 5.0% after second dose).  \n \n \n5 \n \n \nTable 1 Percentage (%) of Participants with Solicited Local or Systemic Adverse \nReactions within 7 Days Following Administration of Any Vaccine Dosea in Study \n4b \nCYFENDUS \nCYFENDUS  \nCYFENDUS  \nBioThrax \nBioThrax  \nBioThrax  \nN \nAny Grade \nGrade 3+ \nN \nAny Grade \nGrade 3+ \nLocal \nAdverse \nReactionsc \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAny \nInjection \nSite \nReaction \n3106 \n93.0% \n3.8% \n527 \n94.9% \n4.6% \nTenderness \n3106 \n88.1% \n1.7% \n527 \n89.9% \n0.8% \nPaind \n3106 \n86.3% \n2.1% \n527 \n87.9% \n0.9% \nArm \nMotion \nLimitation \n3106 \n63.7% \n1.7% \n527 \n51.4% \n0.4% \nWarmth \n3106 \n51.2% \n0.7% \n527 \n68.7% \n0.2% \nInduratione \n3106 \n37.5% \n0.3% \n527 \n75.5% \n1.1% \nItching \n3106 \n21.9% \n0.4% \n527 \n58.8% \n0.8% \nSwellinge \n3106 \n19.7% \n0.4% \n527 \n55.4% \n1.3% \nErythema/\nRednessf \n3106 \n17.9% \n0.9% \n527 \n53.9% \n1.9% \nBruising \n3106 \n17.2% \n0.3% \n527 \n34.9% \n0.0% \nSystemic \nAdverse \nReactionsg \n \n \nAny \nSystemic \nReaction \n3115 \n84.3% \n6.6% \n528 \n78.4% \n3.8% \nMuscle \nAche \n3106 \n75.2% \n3.5% \n527 \n63.4% \n1.9% \nTiredness \n3106 \n67.1% \n2.9% \n527 \n53.7% \n1.7% \nHeadache \n3106 \n58.0% \n3.2% \n527 \n47.6% \n2.1% \nFeverh \n3113 \n6.8% \n0.7% \n527 \n1.7% \n0.4% \na 3151participants received at least one dose, and 2898 participants received two doses of CYFENDUS. \nb Percentage of participants reporting solicited local or systemic adverse reactions in e-diaries and during in-clinic \nreactogenicity assessments for at least 7 days following any dose (CYFENDUS up to two doses intramuscularly, \nBioThrax up to three doses subcutaneously).  \nc No Grade 4 local adverse reactions were reported for CYFENDUS.

None of the reported deaths (n=6, 0.2%) or SAEs (n=62, \n1.9%) were determined to be related to the administration of CYFENDUS.  \nPotentially Immune-mediated Adverse Events  \nIn the pooled safety population, participants were monitored for the occurrence of new-onset \npotentially immune-mediated adverse events for 12 months after the first dose of vaccine. Events \nwere adjudicated as to whether they were of autoimmune etiology by an external expert blinded \nto treatment assignment. As determined by the adjudicator, three events of autoimmune etiology \nin three participants were considered possibly related to the administration of CYFENDUS: (1) a \ncase of ulcerative colitis that occurred 208 days after the administration of CYFENDUS, (2) a \ncase of chronic idiopathic urticaria that occurred 76 days after the administration of CYFENDUS \nand (3) a case of diffuse alopecia that occurred 17 days after the administration of CYFENDUS.  \n \n \n7 \n \n \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience \nThere is no postmarketing experience following administration of CYFENDUS. However, the \npostmarketing safety experience with BioThrax is relevant because BioThrax and CYFENDUS \ncontain the same active ingredient and are manufactured similarly. BioThrax does not contain \nCPG 7909 adjuvant. \nThe following adverse events have been spontaneously reported during the postmarketing use of \nBioThrax and may occur in people receiving CYFENDUS. Because these events are reported \nvoluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their \nfrequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Adverse events included below \nare listed due to one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the event, (2) number of \nreports, or (3) strength of causal relationship to BioThrax.   \n• Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Lymphadenopathy  \n• Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea \n• Immune system disorders: Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, \nurticaria, pruritus, erythema multiforme, anaphylactoid reaction, and Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome) \n• Nervous system disorders: Paresthesia, syncope, dizziness, tremor, ulnar nerve neuropathy  \n• Musculoskeletal, connective tissue, and bone disorders: Arthralgia, arthropathy, myalgia, \nrhabdomyolysis, alopecia  \n• General disorders and administration site conditions: Malaise, pain, cellulitis, flu-like \nsymptoms \n• Psychiatric disorders: Insomnia \n• Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Pruritus, rash, urticaria \n• Vascular disorders: Flushing  \nReports of the following were also received: multisystem disorder defined as chronic symptoms \ninvolving at least two of the following three categories: fatigue, mood-cognition, and \nmusculoskeletal system. \n8 \n \n \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.1 \nPregnancy \nRisk Summary \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In clinically \nrecognized pregnancies in the US general population, the estimated background risk of major \nbirth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20%. \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of CYFENDUS in pregnant individuals.  \nAvailable human data on CYFENDUS administered to pregnant individuals do not establish the \npresence or absence of vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy (see Human Data). However, \navailable data on BioThrax (a licensed anthrax vaccine), administered to pregnant individuals are \nrelevant to CYFENDUS because BioThrax and CYFENDUS contain the same active ingredient \nand are manufactured similarly. BioThrax does not contain CPG 7909 adjuvant. Data are \navailable from a BioThrax observational study and pregnancy exposure registry. \nIn the observational study there were more birth defects in infants born to individuals vaccinated \nwith BioThrax in the first trimester compared to individuals vaccinated post pregnancy or \nindividuals never vaccinated with BioThrax. Data from the BioThrax pregnancy exposure \nregistry do not establish the presence or absence of vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy (see \nHuman Data). \nIn a developmental study with an embryo-fetal development toxicity phase, female rats were \nadministered a full human dose (0.5 mL) of CYFENDUS twice prior to mating and once during \ngestation. This study revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus, changes in reproductive \nperformance, or adverse effects on post-natal development due to the vaccine (see Animal Data).  \nData \nHuman Data \nIn pre-licensure clinical studies of CYFENDUS, women underwent pregnancy testing \nimmediately prior to administration of each dose of CYFENDUS. Despite this pregnancy \nscreening regimen, some subjects were vaccinated with CYFENDUS very early in pregnancy \nbefore human chorionic gonadotropin was detectable (n=10) or in the 30 days prior to pregnancy \nonset (n=1). Of the 11 pregnancies (one twin pregnancy), 1 (9.1%) resulted in miscarriage and \nthere were 2 infants (18.2 %) born with major birth defects.  \nAn observational study examined the rate of birth defects among 37,140 infants born to US \nmilitary service personnel who received BioThrax during pregnancy between 1998 and 2004. In \nthis study, birth defects were slightly more common in first trimester-exposed infants (4.68%) \nwhen compared with infants of individuals vaccinated post pregnancy (3.85%) (odds ratio = \n1.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.005, 1.43) or when compared to individuals never vaccinated \nwith BioThrax (4.03%) (odds ratio = 1.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.42)1. \n9 \n \n \nA pregnancy exposure registry was conducted in individuals who received BioThrax. Of 91 \nindividuals who reported pregnancy outcomes, the majority of exposures were in the first \ntrimester (n=89), and there were two infants with major birth defects (2.2%) and no miscarriages.   \nAnimal Data \nIn a pre- and post-natal developmental study with an embryo-fetal development toxicity phase \nperformed in female rats, a full human dose (0.5 mL) of CYFENDUS was administered by \nintramuscular injection on three occasions: 14 days prior to start of cohabitation, on the day of \ncohabitation, and on Gestation Day 7. No vaccine-related adverse effects on fetal development, \nreproductive performance, or pre- and post-natal development up to post-natal day 21 in the \noffspring were reported. \n8.2 \nLactation \nRisk Summary  \nIt is not known whether CYFENDUS is excreted in human milk. Human data are not available to \nassess the impact of the vaccine on milk production, its presence in breast milk, or its effects on \nthe breastfed child. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered \nalong with the mother's clinical need for CYFENDUS and any potential adverse effects on the \nbreastfed child, or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the \nunderlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. \n8.4 \nPediatric Use \nSafety and effectiveness of CYFENDUS in individuals younger than 18 years of age have not \nbeen established. \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use \nSafety and effectiveness of CYFENDUS in individuals older than 65 years of age have not been \nestablished. \n11 DESCRIPTION \nCYFENDUS (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed, Adjuvanted) is a sterile, milky-white suspension for \nintramuscular administration.  \nCYFENDUS is made from cell-free filtrates of microaerophilic cultures of an avirulent, \nnonencapsulated strain of B. anthracis. The production cultures are grown in a chemically \ndefined protein-free medium consisting of a mixture of amino acids, vitamins, inorganic salts, \nand sugars. CYFENDUS is prepared from sterile culture filtrates containing proteins released \nduring growth, including the 83-kDa protective antigen protein, and contains no dead or live \nbacteria. The sterile culture filtrates containing the proteins are adsorbed onto aluminum \n10 \n \n \nhydroxide adjuvant and combined with a saline preservative solution containing the excipients \nsodium chloride, formaldehyde, benzethonium chloride, and water for injection. CPG 7909 \nadjuvant is added to the preservative solution containing the adsorbed proteins to form \nCYFENDUS.  \nCPG 7909 adjuvant is a synthetic DNA molecule 24 nucleotides in length with a nuclease-\nresistant phosphorothioate backbone.  \nCYFENDUS contains 100 mcg/mL total adsorbed cell-free filtrate, 1.3 mg/mL aluminum \nadjuvant, 0.5 mg/mL CPG 7909 adjuvant, and 0.85% sodium chloride, with 25 mcg/mL \nbenzethonium chloride and 100 mcg/mL formaldehyde added as preservatives. A single dose of \nCYFENDUS is 0.5 mL. \n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action \nAnthrax is an infectious disease caused by the Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium \nB. anthracis.   \nCYFENDUS induces antibodies against protective antigen protein that may contribute to \nprotection by neutralizing the activities of the cytotoxic lethal toxin and edema toxin of  \nB. anthracis.   \n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility \nCYFENDUS has not been evaluated for carcinogenicity, mutagenic potential, or male infertility \nin animals. CYFENDUS administered to female rats had no effect on fertility [see Use in \nSpecific Populations (8.1)].  \n13.2 \nAnimal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology \nAnimal Pharmacology \nBecause it is not feasible or ethical to conduct controlled clinical trials with anthrax, the efficacy \nof CYFENDUS is based on animal studies with CYFENDUS and BioThrax. Pre-exposure \nprophylaxis studies conducted in animal models were used to derive protective antibody \nthresholds to bridge animal efficacy and human immunogenicity data and predict efficacy in \nhumans. \nPivotal efficacy animal studies with BioThrax were conducted in rabbits and nonhuman primates \n(NHPs). Animals received two intramuscular vaccinations four weeks apart with serial dilutions \nof BioThrax and were subjected to lethal challenge on study day 70 with aerosolized B. anthracis \nspores at a target dose exceeding the 50% lethal dose by 200-fold. Serum samples were collected \nat various time points prior to challenge for immune response analysis via anthrax lethal toxin \n11 \n \n \nneutralizing antibody (TNA) assay. The relationship between pre-challenge serum TNA levels \nand survival was evaluated. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a 70% probability of \nsurvival was associated with a TNA NF50 (50% neutralization factor) level of 0.56 in rabbits and \n0.29 in NHPs.  \nEfficacy studies for CYFENDUS were conducted in guinea pigs and cynomolgus macaques. \nAnimals received two intramuscular vaccinations two weeks apart with various dilutions of \nCYFENDUS and were challenged with a lethal dose of aerosolized B. anthracis spores on Day \n28 or 70. The studies demonstrated a strong correlation between pre-challenge serum TNA levels \nand survival.  \nThe ability of CYFENDUS to increase survival after the cessation of the post-exposure \nantibacterial treatment, as compared with antibacterial treatment alone, was investigated in a \nguinea pig post-exposure prophylaxis study. In this study, guinea pigs were challenged with a \nlethal dose of aerosolized B. anthracis spores on Day 0 and treated with ciprofloxacin (7.5 mg/kg \nthree times daily) for two weeks after the challenge. Various dilutions of the vaccine were \nadministered on Days 1 and 8 after the challenge. Post-exposure vaccination increased animal \nsurvival in the 21-day period following cessation of antibacterial drugs, compared to \nantibacterial treatment alone, in a dose-dependent manner.  \n14 CLINICAL STUDIES  \n14.1 \nPost-Exposure Prophylaxis \nThe efficacy of CYFENDUS is based on studies of both CYFENDUS and BioThrax in animals \n[see Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (13.2)]. \nBased on the animal model-derived TNA thresholds from studies of BioThrax, a multicenter, \nrandomized, active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical study (Study 4; \nNCT03877926) was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a post-exposure \nadministration schedule of two doses (0.5 mL) of CYFENDUS intramuscularly two weeks apart \nin adults ages 18 through 65 years. In the study, 3151 participants received at least one dose of \nCYFENDUS, and 533 participants received at least one dose (0.5 mL) of the comparator \nlicensed anthrax vaccine, BioThrax. Participants were followed for immunogenicity up to Day \n64 (7 weeks after last CYFENDUS vaccination, 5 weeks after last BioThrax vaccination) [see \nAdverse Reactions (6.1)].  \nThe mean age of participants in the per protocol (PP) population receiving CYFENDUS \n(n=2543) was 39.4 years. Of these, 57.8% of participants were female, 78.1% were White, \n17.0% were Black or African American, 1.7% were multiracial, 1.6% were Asian, 0.5% were \nOther, 0.4% were American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 0.4% were Native Hawaiian or \nPacific Islander. There were 13.8% Hispanic or Latino participants.  \n12 \n \n \nThe primary immunogenicity objectives were to assess CYFENDUS vaccine-induced TNA 50% \nneutralization factor (NF50) response at Day 64 and non-inferiority to BioThrax following two \ndoses of CYFENDUS administered intramuscularly two weeks apart (Week 0 and 2) and three \ndoses of BioThrax administered subcutaneously two weeks apart (Week 0, 2, and 4). The two co-\nprimary immunogenicity endpoints and statistical evaluation criteria were:  \n• Percentage of CYFENDUS recipients achieving a threshold TNA NF50 value ≥0.56 at Day \n64 (with the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval [CI] for the proportion \n≥40%) and,  \n• The percent difference between participants achieving a threshold TNA NF50 value ≥0.29 at \nDay 64 in those who received CYFENDUS and those who received BioThrax (with the \nlower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference being greater than -15%).  \nThe TNA NF50 thresholds of 0.56 and 0.29 were based on the TNA NF50 values in rabbits and \nnonhuman primates, respectively, that were associated with 70% probability of survival in pre-\nexposure prophylaxis studies, in which animals were immunized with BioThrax and \nsubsequently challenged with aerosolized B. anthracis spores [see Animal Toxicology and/or \nPharmacology (13.2)].  \nOverall, 66.3% of CYFENDUS participants from the PP population achieved threshold TNA \nNF50 value ≥0.56 on Day 64 in the study; the lower bound of the 95% CI was 64.4% (Table 2).  \nTable 2. Percentage of Participants Achieving TNA NF50 Threshold in Clinical Study 4 at \nDay 64 After Administration of Two Doses of CYFENDUS (Per Protocol \nPopulation) \nDay 64 \nCYFENDUS \nN= number of participants in PP population \n2543 \nPercent (95% CI) of participants meeting the \nTNA NF50 ≥0.56 threshold  \n66.3 (64.4, 68.1)  \nCI = Confidence interval; NF50 = 50% neutralization factor; PP = Per protocol; TNA = Toxin neutralizing antibody. \nCYFENDUS was considered to have achieved a protective level of immunity at Day 64 if the lower bound for the \ntwo-sided 95% CI for the percentage of participants with TNA NF50 values above the specified threshold of \nprotection (≥0.56) was ≥40%. \n \nThe percent of participants with a threshold TNA NF50 of ≥0.29 at Day 64 was 86.6% in the \nCYFENDUS group compared with 61.4% in the BioThrax group, corresponding to a difference \nof 25.2%. The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference was 20.5%, thereby \ndemonstrating non-inferiority of CYFENDUS to BioThrax (Table 3). \n \n \n13 \n \n \nTable 3.

The potential effect of CYFENDUS vaccination on ciprofloxacin or doxycycline \nserum levels was assessed by evaluating steady-state pharmacokinetic profiles of ciprofloxacin \nor doxycycline before and after vaccination with a two-dose series of CYFENDUS.  \nConcomitant administration of 0.5 mL of CYFENDUS intramuscularly with oral ciprofloxacin \nor doxycycline in participants did not have a clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics \nof ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, or the immunogenicity of CYFENDUS as measured by the \nTNA assay.  \n15 REFERENCES \n1.

The final preparation prior to freeze \ndrying also contains lactose. The freeze-dried BCG preparation is delivered in vials, each \ncontaining 1 to 8 x 108 colony forming units (CFU) of BCG which is equivalent to approximately \n50 mg wet weight. Determination of in-vitro potency is achieved through colony counts derived \nfrom a serial dilution assay. Intradermal guinea pig testing is also used as an indirect measure \nof potency. \nReconstitution requires addition of Sterile Water for Injection, U.S.P. at 4–25°C (39–77°F). For \nan adult dosage, 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, U.S.P., should be added to one vial of \nvaccine. For a pediatric dosage, 2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, U.S.P., should be added to \none vial of vaccine (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). \nNo preservatives have been added. \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \nTuberculosis (TB) is primarily an airborne communicable disease caused by the bacterium, \nMycobacterium tuberculosis. \nTuberculosis is an important global public health problem with an estimated 8–10 million cases \nand 2–3 million deaths occurring each year.2 The control of TB in the United States has been a \nconstant challenge particularly with the resurgence in TB in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. \nIn the United States, TB had declined approximately 6% per year since nationwide reporting \nbegan in 1953. However, in 1985 there was a 1.1% increase over the previous year. This \nupward trend continued through 1992, when the incidence was 10.5 cases per 100,000 \npopulation. In 1993, there was a 5.2% decrease over 1992 with a rate of 9.8 cases per 100,000 \npopulation.3 In 1997, the total TB cases reported was 19,855 or 7.4 cases per 100,000 people. \nThis incidence rate represented the fifth consecutive year that number of reported TB cases had \ndeclined and a 26% decrease since the peak in 1992.4 \nIn the 1990s, drug-resistant TB also became a significant public health concern. During the \nperiod of 1993–1996, in the United States, 13.1% of TB patients were infected with TB strains \nthat were resistant to at least one drug used as first-line treatment for TB (isoniazid, rifampin, \n \nBCG Vaccine USP Insert \n900151-BCG-PWI-USPI-2 \n \np1 of 13 \npyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin) and 2.2% of TB patients were infected with TB \nstrains that were multiple drug resistant (MDR as defined by resistance to both isoniazid and \nrifampin). Cases of MDR-TB were reported from 42 states and Washington D.C. during this time \nperiod.5 \nMost persons infected with M. tuberculosis remain infected for many years by developing latent \ninfections. Active TB will reactivate during the lifetime of 5–15% of infected patients who are \nimmunocompetent. In general, active TB is fatal for about 50% of persons who have not been \ntreated.3 The greatest known risk factor for developing active TB disease is immunodeficiency, \nparticularly if caused by coinfection with HIV.4 Persons infected with HIV are estimated to be \nover one hundred times as likely as uninfected persons to develop TB, primarily as a result of \nreactivation of a latent TB infection.6 Other groups at high risk for developing TB include foreign-\nborn individuals and persons in institutional settings such as correctional facilities, shelters for \nthe homeless, and nursing homes. \nAlthough over 2 billion people have been immunized with BCG, and it is currently an officially \nrecommended vaccine in more than 180 countries, excluding the U.S., the efficacy of BCG as a \nvaccine against tuberculosis remains controversial. Prospective vaccine efficacy trials have \nshown that the protective benefit of BCG (various strains from different manufacturers) against \nclinical TB was variable, ranging from 0–80%.7 A recent meta-analysis of data from 14 \nprospective trials and 12 case control studies concluded that the overall protective effect of \nBCG against tuberculosis infection was 50%.8 The reasons for the wide range of effectiveness \nseen in these studies are unknown but may be attributed to the following: vaccination was not \nallocated randomly in observational studies; there were differences in BCG strains, methods, \nand routes of administration; and there were differences in the characteristics of the populations \nand environments in which the vaccines were studied.9 Despite the conflicting results \nconcerning prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis, it is widely acknowledged that immunization of \ninfants with BCG lowers the risk of disseminated complications of this disease. Estimates in \nareas where BCG vaccination is performed at birth indicate that the effectiveness of BCG in \npreventing childhood TB meningitis or miliary TB exceeds 70%.10–15 \nIn a prospective trial using the TICE® strain of BCG VACCINE, Rosenthal, et al., studied 1,716 \nvaccinated and 1,665 non-vaccinated infants, all born at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago \nand followed for 12–23 years. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was made following a review of \nchest X-ray results and clinical findings. There were 17 cases of tuberculosis among the \nvaccinated (0.43/1,000/yr) and 65 cases in the nonvaccinated (1.7/1,000/yr); this is a reduction \nof 75% (p<0.001) in cases of tuberculosis. One death was attributed to tuberculosis in the \nvaccinated group with 6 deaths in the controls, or a reduction of 83%. There were 639 families \nin which there was a sibling in both the control and vaccination groups. Eight of the 790 \nvaccinated subjects developed tuberculosis as compared with 30 of the 945 controls (p<0.001). \nThirteen cases of nonfatal tuberculosis developed in the control group that were 2 years of age \nand under, with none in the vaccinated group. \nThere were 3 deaths from tuberculosis in the control group that were less than 2.5 years of age \n(all had miliary tuberculosis with meningitis), with one death in the vaccinated group \n(meningitis). The infant who died in the vaccinated group had not converted to a positive PPD \nskin test at 6 months of age and was never subsequently revaccinated. Following a single \nvaccination, 99.3% of all infants studied became PPD positive, with 84.2% still being positive \nafter 8 years.16 \n \nBCG Vaccine USP Insert \n900151-BCG-PWI-USPI-2 \n \np2 of 13 \nIn a 1995 study of vaccine potency, 26 tuberculin negative subjects were vaccinated with BCG \nVACCINE (TICE® strain) and subsequent tuberculin conversion was monitored. Conversion \nfrom a negative to a positive skin test may be considered a surrogate indicator of potency and \nimmunization efficacy of BCG Vaccines; however, the correlation between PPD conversion and \nvaccine effectiveness has not been established. Twenty-four (24) subjects returned for follow-up \ntesting with PPD 10 tuberculin units (10 TU) 8 weeks after vaccination. Twenty-two (22) of the \n24 subjects converted to positive (skin test reading >5mm induration at 48 hours) and 2 \nremained negative. The conversion rate was 92% and the average positive skin test reading \nwas 15.5mm in induration.17 \nIn a second study, 22 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 40 who were not health care \nworkers, were not foreign born, were HIV negative, and were negative responders to a 10 TU \nPPD skin test were vaccinated with the standard dose of BCG VACCINE (TICE® strain). Eight \nweeks after vaccination the subjects returned for a 10 TU skin test. Twenty-one (21) out of 22 \nconverted to PPD positive at a level greater than 5mm for a skin test conversion rate of 95%.17 \nINDICATIONS AND USAGE \nBCG VACCINE (TICE® strain) is indicated for the prevention of tuberculosis in persons \nnot previously infected with M. tuberculosis who are at high risk for exposure. As with \nany vaccine, immunization with BCG VACCINE may not protect 100% of susceptible \nindividuals. \nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Advisory Committee \nfor the Elimination of Tuberculosis has recommended that BCG vaccination be \nconsidered in the following circumstances.3 \nTB Exposed Tuberculin Skin Test-Negative Infants and Children \nBCG vaccination is recommended for infants and children with negative tuberculin skin tests \nwho are (a) at high risk of intimate and prolonged exposure to persistently untreated or \nineffectively treated patients with infectious pulmonary tuberculosis and who cannot be removed \nfrom the source of exposure and cannot be placed on long-term primary preventive therapy, or \n(b) continuously exposed to persons with infectious pulmonary tuberculosis who have bacilli \nresistant to isoniazid and rifampin, and the child cannot be separated from the presence of the \ninfectious patient.3 \nTB Exposed Health Care Workers (HCW) in High Risk Settings \nBCG vaccination of HCWs should be considered on an individual basis in settings where (a) a \nhigh percentage of TB patients are infected with M. tuberculosis strains resistant to both \nisoniazid and rifampin, (b) transmission of such drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains to HCWs \nand subsequent infection are likely, and (c) comprehensive TB infection control precautions \nhave been implemented and have not been successful. Vaccination should not be required for \nemployment or for assignment of HCWs in specific work areas. HCWs considered for BCG \nvaccination should be counseled regarding the risks and benefits associated with both BCG \nvaccinations and TB preventive therapy.3 \n \nBCG Vaccine USP Insert \n900151-BCG-PWI-USPI-2 \n \np3 of 13 \nExposed Health Care Workers in Low Risk Settings \nBCG vaccination is not recommended for HCWs in settings in which the risk for M. tuberculosis \ntransmission is low.3 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \nBCG VACCINE for prevention of tuberculosis should not be given to persons (a) whose \nimmunologic responses are impaired because of HIV infections, congenital immunodeficiency \nsuch as chronic granulomatous disease or interferon gamma receptor deficiency, leukemia, \nlymphoma, or generalized malignancy or (b) whose immunologic responses have been \nsuppressed by steroids, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, or radiation.3 BCG VACCINE should \nnot be administered to HIV-infected or immunocompromised infants, children, or adults. \nPrior to administration, the possibility of allergic reactions should be assessed. Allergy to any \ncomponent of BCG VACCINE or an anaphylactic or allergic reaction to a previous dose of BCG \nVACCINE are contraindications for vaccination. \nBCG VACCINE is not a vaccine for the treatment of active tuberculosis. \nBCG VACCINE should not be used in infants, children, or adults with severe immune deficiency \nsyndromes. Children with a family history of immune deficiency disease should not be \nvaccinated; if they are, an infectious disease specialist should be consulted and anti-\ntuberculous therapy administered if clinically indicated.18 \nWARNINGS \nAdministration should be by the percutaneous route with the multiple puncture device as \ndescribed below. DO NOT INJECT INTRAVENOUSLY, SUBCUTANEOUSLY, \nINTRAMUSCULARLY OR INTRADERMALLY. \nAlthough BCG vaccination often results in local adverse effects, serious or long-term \ncomplications are rare. Reactions that can be expected after vaccination include moderate \naxillary or cervical lymphadenopathy and induration and subsequent pustule formation at the \ninjection site; these reactions can persist for as long as 3 months after vaccination. More severe \nlocal reactions include ulceration at the vaccination site, regional suppurative lymphadenitis with \ndraining sinuses, and caseous lesions or purulent drainage at the puncture site; these \nmanifestations might occur within the 5 months after vaccination and could persist for several \nweeks. \nAcute, localized irritative toxicities of BCG may be accompanied by systemic manifestations, \nconsistent with a “flu-like” syndrome. Systemic adverse effects of 1–2 days’ duration such as \nfever, anorexia, myalgia, and neuralgia, often reflect hypersensitivity reactions. However, \nsymptoms such as fever of 103°F or greater, or acute localized inflammation persisting longer \nthan 2–3 days suggest active infections, and evaluation for serious infectious complication \nshould be considered. If a BCG infection is suspected, the physician should consult with an \ninfectious disease expert before therapy is initiated. Treatment should be started without delay. \nIn patients who develop persistent fever or experience an acute febrile illness consistent with \nBCG infection, two or more antimycobacterial agents should be administered while diagnostic \nevaluation, including cultures, is conducted. Negative cultures do not necessarily rule out \ninfection. Physicians or persons caring for patients that use this product should be familiar with \n \nBCG Vaccine USP Insert \n900151-BCG-PWI-USPI-2 \n \np4 of 13 \nthe literature on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of BCG-related complications and, when \nappropriate, should consult an infectious disease specialist or other physician with experience in \nthe diagnosis and treatment of mycobacterial infections. \nThe most serious complication of BCG vaccination is disseminated BCG infection. BCG osteitis \naffecting the epiphyses of the long bones, particularly the epiphyses of the leg, can occur from 4 \nmonths to 2 years after vaccination. Fatal disseminated BCG disease has occurred at a rate of \n0.06–1.56 cases per million doses of vaccine administered; these deaths occurred primarily \namong immunocompromised persons.3 The appropriate therapy for systemic BCG infections is \ndiscussed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section. \nPRECAUTIONS \nGeneral \nBCG VACCINE contains live bacteria and should be used with aseptic technique. To avoid \ncross-contamination, parenteral drugs should not be prepared in areas where BCG \nVACCINE has been in use.19 A separate sterile multiple puncture device must be used for \neach patient and appropriately discarded after use. All equipment, supplies and receptacles in \ncontact with BCG VACCINE should be handled and disposed of as biohazardous (see \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). \nBCG VACCINE administration should not be attempted in individuals with severe immune \ndeficiency disease. BCG VACCINE should be administered with caution to persons in groups at \nhigh risk for HIV infection. \nA review of each patient’s immunization records to include history on reactions to immunizations \nshould be completed prior to vaccination. All precautions should be taken for the prevention of \nallergic or any other side reactions, including understanding the use of the biological and the \nnature of the adverse reactions that may follow its use. Epinephrine injection (1:1000) for the \ncontrol of immediate allergic reactions must be available should an acute anaphylactic reaction \noccur. \nVaccination is recommended only for those who are tuberculin negative to a recent skin test \nwith 5 TU. \nAfter BCG vaccination, it is usually not possible to clearly distinguish between a tuberculin \nreaction caused by persistent post-vaccination sensitivity and one caused by a virulent \nsuprainfection. Caution is advised in attributing a positive skin test to BCG vaccination. A sharp \nrise in the tuberculin reaction since the latest test should be further investigated (except in the \nimmediate post-vaccination period). \nInformation to the Patient \nBefore administration of BCG VACCINE, health care personnel should inform patients or \nguardians of the benefits and risks of immunization and inquire about the health status of the \npatient. Health care workers considering BCG vaccination should be counseled regarding the \nrisks and benefits associated with both BCG vaccination and TB preventive therapy. They \nshould be informed about (a) the variable data concerning the efficacy of BCG vaccination, (b) \nthe interference with the diagnosis of newly acquired M. tuberculosis infections in BCG-\nvaccinated persons, and (c) the potential serious complications associated with BCG \n \nBCG Vaccine USP Insert \n900151-BCG-PWI-USPI-2 \n \np5 of 13 \nvaccination of immunocompromised individuals. Health care workers should be informed about \n(a) the lack of data regarding the efficacy of preventive therapy for MDR-TB infections and (b) \nthe risks of drug toxicity associated with multi-drug preventive therapy regimens. \nFollowing BCG vaccination, no dressing is required; however, it is recommended that the site be \nloosely covered and kept dry for 24 hours. The vaccination site should be kept clean until the \nlocal reaction has disappeared. The patient should be advised that the vaccine contains live \norganisms. Although the vaccine will not survive in a dry state for long, infection of others is \npossible. Following vaccination with BCG, initial skin lesions usually appear within 10–14 days \nand consist of small red papules at the vaccination site. The papules reach a maximum \ndiameter (about 3 mm) after 4 to 6 weeks, after which they may scale and slowly subside. Six \nmonths afterwards there is usually no visible sign of the vaccination, though on occasion, a \nfaintly discernable pattern of the points from the multiple puncture device may be visible. On \nindividuals whose skin tends to form keloids, there may be slightly more visible evidence of the \nvaccination. Any unusual adverse reactions should be reported to the health care provider. \nPatients may experience “flu-like” symptoms for 24–48 hours following BCG vaccination. \nHowever, the patient should consult with their physician immediately if they experience fever of \n103°F or greater, or acute local reactions persisting longer than 2–3 days. \nLaboratory Tests \nBCG vaccination results in tuberculin skin test reactivity. Tuberculin skin test reactivity as a \nresult of BCG vaccination cannot be readily differentiated from reactivity following exposure to \ntuberculosis. BCG vaccination should not be administered to individuals with a positive \ntuberculin skin test. \n \nPrior administration of BCG vaccine has not been associated with a positive interferon \ngamma release assay (IGRA) test, which are indirect tests for M. tuberculosis infection \n(including disease) and are intended for use in conjunction with risk assessment, \nradiography and other medical and diagnostic evaluations. 26,27 \nDrug Interactions \nAntimicrobial or immunosuppressive agents may interfere with the development of the immune \nresponse and should be used only under medical supervision. \nSince BCG is a live vaccine, the immune response to the vaccine might be impaired if \nadministered within 30 days of another live vaccine. However, no evidence exists for currently \navailable vaccines to support this concern. Whenever possible, live vaccines administered on \ndifferent days should be administered at least 30 days apart.20 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nBCG VACCINE has not been evaluated for carcinogenic, mutagenic potentials or impairment of \nfertility. \nPregnancy Category C \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with BCG VACCINE. It is also not known \nwhether BCG VACCINE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can \n \nBCG Vaccine USP Insert \n900151-BCG-PWI-USPI-2 \n \np6 of 13 \naffect reproductive capacity. Although no harmful effects to the fetus have been associated with \nBCG VACCINE, its use is not recommended during pregnancy.3 \nNursing Mothers \nIt is not known whether BCG is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in \nhuman milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from BCG in nursing \ninfants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or not to vaccinate, taking \ninto account the importance of tuberculosis vaccination to the mother. \nPediatric Use \nSee Treatment and Schedule under DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. Precautions \nshould be taken with respect to infants vaccinated with BCG and exposed to persons with active \ntuberculosis.21 \nGeriatric Use \nClinical studies of BCG VACCINE did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and \nover to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported \nclinical experience has not identified differences in response between elderly and younger \npatients. An intact immune system is a prerequisite for BCG vaccination. If the immune status of \nan elderly patient, or any patient, is in question, the BCG vaccination should be held until the \nimmune status of the patient has been evaluated. \nADVERSE REACTIONS \nAlthough BCG vaccination often causes local reactions, serious or long-term \ncomplications are rare.3 Reactions that can be expected after vaccination include moderate \naxillary or cervical lymphadenopathy and induration and subsequent pustule formation at the \ninjection site; these reactions can persist for as long as 3 months after vaccination. More \nserious local reactions include ulceration at the vaccination site, regional suppurative \nlymphadenitis with draining sinuses, and caseous lesions or purulent draining at the puncture \nsite. These manifestations might occur up to 5 months after vaccination and could persist for \nseveral weeks. The intensity and duration of the local reaction depends on the depth of \npenetration of the multiple puncture device and individual variations in patients’ tissue reactions. \nSlight tenderness at the puncture site may be encountered as well as some itching. The initial \nskin lesions usually appear within 10–14 days and consist of small red papules at the site. The \npapules reach maximum diameter (about 3 mm) after 4 to 6 weeks, after which they may scale \nand then slowly subside. \nThe most serious complication of BCG vaccination is disseminated BCG infection.24,25 The most \nfrequent disseminated infection is BCG osteomyelitis (0.01 to 43 cases per million doses of \nvaccine administered) which usually occurs 4 months to 2 years after vaccination. Fatal \ndisseminated BCG infection has occurred at a rate of 0.06–1.56 cases per million doses; these \ndeaths occurred primarily among immunocompromised persons. \nBCG Vaccination of Individuals Infected with HIV \nThe safety of BCG vaccination in HIV-infected adults and children, including infants, has not \nbeen determined by controlled or large studies. This is a concern because of the association \n \nBCG Vaccine USP Insert \n900151-BCG-PWI-USPI-2 \n \np7 of 13 \nbetween disseminated BCG infection and underlying immunosuppression. Individuals with HIV \ninfection should not receive the BCG VACCINE.3 \nTreatment of Adverse Reactions \nIf a systemic BCG infection occurs, an infectious disease expert should be consulted and anti-\ntuberculosis therapy should be initiated. Since BCG strains are resistant to pyrazinamide, this \nantibiotic should not be used. \nReporting of Adverse Reactions \nAll suspected adverse reactions to BCG vaccination should be reported to Organon USA Inc. at \n(800) 842-3220 and to the Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System (VAERS); telephone (800) \n822-7967. These reactions occasionally could occur more than 1 year after vaccination. \nOVERDOSAGE \nAccidental overdosages if treated immediately with anti-tuberculous drugs have not led to \ncomplications.22 If the vaccination response is allowed to progress it can still be treated \nsuccessfully with anti-tuberculous drugs but complications can include regional adenitis, lupus \nvulgaris, subcutaneous cold abscesses, ocular lesions, and others.23 \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \nPreparation of Agent \nThe preparation of the BCG VACCINE suspension should be done using aseptic technique. To \navoid cross-contamination, parenteral drugs should not be prepared in areas where BCG \nVACCINE has been prepared. A separate area for the preparation of the BCG VACCINE \nsuspension is recommended. All equipment, supplies and receptacles in contact with BCG \nVACCINE should be handled and disposed of as biohazardous. The pharmacist or individual \nresponsible for mixing the agent should wear gloves, and take precautions to avoid contact of \nBCG with broken skin. If preparation cannot be performed in a biocontainment hood, then a \nmask and gown should be worn to avoid inhalation of BCG organisms and inadvertent exposure \nto broken skin. \nUsing aseptic methods, 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, U.S.P. at 4–25°C (39–77°F), is \nadded to one vial of vaccine (see Pediatric Dose below for pediatric use). Gently swirl the vial \nuntil a homogenous suspension is obtained. Avoid forceful agitation which may cause clumping \nof the mycobacteria. \nPersons administering vaccines should take necessary precautions to minimize risk for \nspreading disease. Hands should be washed before each new patient is seen. Syringes and \nneedles used for applications must be sterile and preferably disposable to minimize the risk of \ncontamination. A separate needle and syringe should be used for each application. Disposable \nneedles and the multiple puncture device should be discarded as biohazardous waste in \nlabeled, puncture-proof containers to prevent inadvertent needlestick injury or reuse.20 After \nuse, any unused vaccine and all materials exposed to the product should be immediately placed \nin a biohazard container and disposed of in an appropriate manner. \n \nBCG Vaccine USP Insert \n900151-BCG-PWI-USPI-2 \n \np8 of 13 \nReconstituted vaccine should be kept refrigerated, protected from exposure to direct sunlight, \nand used within 2 hours. Freezing of the reconstituted product is not recommended. \nNote: DO NOT filter the contents of the BCG VACCINE vial. Precautions should be taken to \navoid exposing the BCG VACCINE to direct sunlight. Bacteriostatic solutions must be avoided. \nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration \nprior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Reconstitution should result in a \nuniform suspension of the bacilli. \nTreatment and Schedule \nBCG vaccination is reserved for persons who have a reaction of <5mm induration after skin \ntesting with 5 TU of PPD tuberculin. The preferred method of skin testing is the Mantoux \ntuberculin skin-test using 0.1 mL of 5 tuberculin units (TU) of purified protein derivative (PPD).3 \nIt is recommended that a Mantoux skin-test be performed prior to BCG vaccination to \ndemonstrate the absence of tuberculous infection. \nThe vaccine is to be administered after fully explaining the risks and benefits to the vaccinee, \nparent, or guardian. BCG vaccination should not be given to individuals previously infected with \nM. tuberculosis. The vaccine is administered percutaneously utilizing a sterile multiple puncture \ndevice. The multiple puncture device consists of a plastic holder for a thin, wafer-like stainless \nsteel plate 7/8\" by 1 1/8\", from which 36 points protrude. After the vaccine is prepared, the skin \nsite is cleansed with an alcohol or acetone sponge and allowed to dry thoroughly.  \n1. Administer the vaccine in the deltoid region (Figure 1). Position the arm  to maintain a \nhorizontal surface where the vaccine is to be placed.  \n \n \nFigure 1 \n2. Drop the immunizing dose of 0.2–0.3 mL of BCG VACCINE from the syringe and needle \nonto the cleansed surface of the skin (Figure 2) and spread over a 1\" by 2\" area using \nthe edge of the multiple puncture device (Figure 3).  \n \n \nBCG Vaccine USP Insert \n900151-BCG-PWI-USPI-2 \n \np9 of 13 \n \n \nFigure 2 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3 \n3. Grasp the arm firmly from underneath, tensing the skin. Center the multiple puncture \ndevice over the vaccine and apply firm downward pressure such that the device points \nare well buried in the skin (Figure 4).  \n \n \nFigure 4 \n \n4. Maintain pressure for 5 seconds. Do not “rock” the device. Release the pressure \nunderneath the arm and remove  the device. In a successful procedure the points \npuncture the skin. If the points do not puncture the skin, the procedure must be \nrepeated.  \n \nBCG Vaccine USP Insert \n900151-BCG-PWI-USPI-2 \n \np10 of 13 \n5. After successful puncture, spread vaccine as evenly as possible over the puncture area \nwith the edge of the device. An additional 1–2 drops of BCG VACCINE may be added to \nensure a very wet vaccination site.  \n6. Use the multiple puncture device once and discard in standard biohazardous sharps \ncontainers.  \n7. Loosely cover the site and keep dry for 24 hours.  \n8. Advise the patient that the vaccine contains live organisms. Although the vaccine will not \nsurvive in a dry state for long, infection of others is possible. \nTuberculin reactivity resulting from BCG vaccination should be documented. A vaccinated \nperson should be tuberculin skin tested 2–3 months after BCG administration, and the test \nresults, in millimeters of induration, should be recorded in the person’s medical record.9 \nVaccination should be repeated for those who remain tuberculin negative to 5 TU of tuberculin \nafter 2–3 months. \nPediatric Dose \nDo not administer INTRAVENOUSLY, SUBCUTANEOUSLY, INTRAMUSCULARLY OR \nINTRADERMALLY. Administer the vaccine in the deltoid region. \nIn infants less than 1 month old, the dosage of BCG VACCINE should be reduced by one-half, \nby using 2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, U.S.P. at 4–25°C (39–77°F) when reconstituting. If \na vaccinated infant remains tuberculin negative to 5 TU on skin testing, and if indications for \nvaccination persist, the infant should receive a full dose after 1 year of age. \nHOW SUPPLIED \nBCG VACCINE is supplied in a box of one vial of BCG. Each vial contains 1 to 8 x 108 CFU, \nwhich is equivalent to approximately 50 mg (wet weight), as lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder, \nNDC 0052-0603-02. \nMultiple puncture devices may be obtained separately from Organon Teknika Corporation LLC, \n100 Rodolphe Street, Building 1300, Durham, NC 27712; telephone number (800) 662-6842. \nStorage \nThe intact vials of BCG VACCINE should be stored refrigerated at 2–8°C (36–46°F). \nThis agent contains live bacteria and should be protected from direct sunlight. The product \nshould not be used after the expiration date printed on the label. \nRx Only \nREFERENCES \n \n1. Guerin C: The history of BCG.

Preparation and Administration Steps  \n \nThis vaccine is supplied in a squeezable tube, which is \ncapped. Vaccine appears clear and colorless.  \n \nPull off the cap and hold the tube upright. Clear the fluid \nfrom the dispensing tip by repeatedly flicking the top of \nthe tube. \n \nInvert the cap, and using the spike inside the top of the \ncap, pierce the membrane by pressing the cap down. Lift \noff the cap, and there should be a hole at the top to \nadminister the vaccine. \n \nFor oral administration only. Have the infant seated in \na reclining position. Place the squeezable tube towards \nthe inner cheek. Administer the contents of the \nsqueezable tube by squeezing liquid into the infant’s \nmouth. A residual drop may remain in the tip of the tube. \n2.2 \nDosing and Schedule  \nThe vaccination series consists of two doses administered orally. The first dose should be \nadministered to infants beginning at 6 weeks of age. There should be an interval of at least \n4 weeks between the first and second dose. The 2-dose series should be completed by 24 weeks \nof age. \nSafety and effectiveness have not been evaluated if ROTARIX were administered for the first \ndose and another rotavirus vaccine were administered for the second dose or vice versa. \n4 \n \nIn the event that the infant spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single \nreplacement dose may be considered at the same vaccination visit. \n2.3 \nInfant Feeding  \nBreastfeeding was permitted in clinical studies. There was no evidence to suggest that \nbreastfeeding reduced the protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis afforded by ROTARIX. \nThere are no restrictions on the infant’s liquid consumption, including breast milk, either before \nor after vaccination with ROTARIX. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nSuspension for oral use.  \nA single dose is 1.5 mL.  \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity  \nA demonstrated history of hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine. \nInfants who develop symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity after receiving a dose of \nROTARIX should not receive further doses of ROTARIX. \n4.2 \nGastrointestinal Tract Congenital Malformation  \nInfants with a history of uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract (such \nas Meckel’s diverticulum) that would predispose the infant for intussusception should not receive \nROTARIX. \n4.3 \nHistory of Intussusception  \nInfants with a history of intussusception should not receive ROTARIX [see Warnings and \nPrecautions (5.4)]. In postmarketing experience, intussusception resulting in death following a \nsecond dose has been reported following a history of intussusception after the first dose [see \nAdverse Reactions (6.2)]. \n4.4 \nSevere Combined Immunodeficiency Disease  \nInfants with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID) should not receive \nROTARIX. Postmarketing reports of gastroenteritis, including severe diarrhea and prolonged \nshedding of vaccine virus, have been reported in infants who were administered live, oral \nrotavirus vaccines and later identified as having SCID [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. \n5 \n \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nGastrointestinal Disorders  \nAdministration of ROTARIX should be delayed in infants suffering from acute diarrhea or \nvomiting. \nSafety and effectiveness of ROTARIX in infants with chronic gastrointestinal disorders have not \nbeen evaluated. [See Contraindications (4.2).] \n5.2 \nAltered Immunocompetence  \nSafety and effectiveness of ROTARIX in infants with known primary or secondary \nimmunodeficiencies, including infants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), infants on \nimmunosuppressive therapy, or infants with malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or \nlymphatic system have not been established. \n5.3 \nShedding and Transmission  \nRotavirus shedding in stool occurs after vaccination with peak excretion occurring around Day 7 \nafter Dose 1. \nOne clinical trial demonstrated that vaccinees transmit vaccine virus to healthy seronegative \ncontacts [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. \nThe potential for transmission of vaccine virus following vaccination should be weighed against \nthe possibility of acquiring and transmitting natural rotavirus. Caution is advised when \nconsidering whether to administer ROTARIX to individuals with immunodeficient close \ncontacts, such as individuals with malignancies, primary immunodeficiency or receiving \nimmunosuppressive therapy. \n5.4 \nIntussusception  \nFollowing administration of a previously licensed oral live rhesus rotavirus-based vaccine, an \nincreased risk of intussusception was observed.1 The risk of intussusception with ROTARIX was \nevaluated in a pre-licensure randomized, placebo-controlled safety study (including 63,225 \ninfants) conducted in Latin America and Finland. No increased risk of intussusception was \nobserved in this clinical trial following administration of ROTARIX when compared with \nplacebo. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] \nIn a postmarketing, observational study conducted in Mexico, cases of intussusception were \nobserved in temporal association within 31 days following the first dose of ROTARIX, with a \nclustering of cases in the first 7 days. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2).] \nOther postmarketing observational studies conducted in Brazil and Australia also suggest an \nincreased risk of intussusception within the first 7 days following the second dose of \nROTARIX.2,3 [See Adverse Reactions (6.2).] \n6 \n \nIn worldwide passive postmarketing surveillance, cases of intussusception have been reported in \ntemporal association with ROTARIX [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. \n5.5 \nPost-Exposure Prophylaxis  \nSafety and effectiveness of ROTARIX when administered after exposure to rotavirus have not \nbeen evaluated. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nThere are two formulations of ROTARIX: a reconstituted lyophilized formulation and a liquid \nformulation. The squeezable tube contains the liquid formulation [see Description (11)]. Safety \ndata accrued with each formulation is relevant to the other because each contains the same live, \nattenuated rotavirus strain and is manufactured using a similar process. \nCommon (≥5%) solicited adverse reactions included fussiness/irritability, cough/runny nose, \nfever, loss of appetite, and vomiting. \nSolicited adverse reactions, unsolicited adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs), and cases \nof intussusception were collected in 7 clinical studies (Studies 1 to 7; NCT00729001, \nNCT00385320, NCT00429481, NCT00757770, NCT00140686, NCT00169455, \nNCT00137930). Cases of intussusception and SAEs were collected in an additional large safety \nstudy (Study 8; NCT00140673) that compared ROTARIX (reconstituted lyophilized \nformulation) to placebo. Solicited adverse reactions, unsolicited adverse events, and SAEs were \ncollected in 3 clinical studies (Studies 9 to 11; NCT02914184, NCT03207750, NCT03954743) \nthat compared the two ROTARIX formulations. \nClinical Trials Experience with ROTARIX (Reconstituted Lyophilized Formulation) \nStudies 1 to 8 evaluated a total of 71,209 infants who received ROTARIX (n = 36,755) or \nplacebo (n = 34,454). The racial distribution for these studies was as follows: Hispanic 73.4%, \nWhite 16.2%, Black 1.0%, and other 9.4%; 51% were male. \nSolicited Adverse Reactions: In 7 clinical studies (Studies 1 to 7), detailed safety information \nwas collected by parents/guardians for 8 consecutive days following vaccination with ROTARIX \n(i.e., day of vaccination and the next 7 days). A diary card was completed to record \nfussiness/irritability, cough/runny nose, the infant’s temperature, loss of appetite, vomiting, or \ndiarrhea on a daily basis during the first week following each dose of ROTARIX or placebo. \nAdverse reactions among recipients of ROTARIX and placebo occurred at similar rates \n(Table 1). \n7 \n \nTable 1.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in \n1.7% of recipients of ROTARIX (n = 36,755) as compared with 1.9% of placebo recipients \n(n = 34,454). Among placebo recipients, diarrhea (placebo 0.07%, ROTARIX 0.02%), \ndehydration (placebo 0.06%, ROTARIX 0.02%), and gastroenteritis (placebo 0.3%, ROTARIX \n0.2%) occurred at a statistically higher incidence (95% CI of RR excluding 1) as compared with \nrecipients of ROTARIX. \nDeaths: During the entire course of 8 clinical studies (Studies 1 to 8), there were 68 (0.19%) \ndeaths following administration of ROTARIX (n = 36,755) and 50 (0.15%) deaths following \nplacebo administration (n = 34,454). The most commonly reported cause of death following \nvaccination was pneumonia, which was observed in 19 (0.05%) recipients of ROTARIX and 10 \n(0.03%) placebo recipients (RR: 1.74, 95% CI: 0.76, 4.23). \n8 \n \nIntussusception: In a controlled safety study (Study 8) conducted in Latin America and Finland, \nthe risk of intussusception was evaluated in 63,225 infants (31,673 received ROTARIX and \n31,552 received placebo). Infants were monitored by active surveillance including independent, \ncomplementary methods (prospective hospital surveillance and parent reporting at scheduled \nstudy visits) to identify potential cases of intussusception within 31 days after vaccination and, in \na subset of 20,169 infants (10,159 received ROTARIX and 10,010 received placebo), up to one \nyear after the first dose. \nNo increased risk of intussusception following administration of ROTARIX was observed within \na 31-day period following any dose, and rates were comparable to the placebo group after a \nmedian of 100 days (Table 2). In a subset of 20,169 infants (10,159 received ROTARIX and \n10,010 received placebo) followed up to one year after Dose 1, there were 4 cases of \nintussusception with ROTARIX compared with 14 cases of intussusception with placebo (RR: \n0.28 [95% CI: 0.10, 0.81]). All of the infants who developed intussusception recovered without \nsequelae. \nTable 2.

Of the 27 cases, 5 occurred \nfollowing ROTARIX in clinical trials that were either not placebo-controlled or 1:1 randomized. \nIn placebo-controlled trials, Kawasaki disease was reported in 17 recipients of ROTARIX and 9 \nplacebo recipients (RR: 1.71 [95% CI: 0.71, 4.38]). Three of the 27 cases were reported within \n30 days post-vaccination: 2 cases (ROTARIX = 1, placebo = 1) were from placebo-controlled \ntrials (RR: 1.00 [95% CI: 0.01, 78.35]) and one case following ROTARIX was from a non–\nplacebo-controlled trial. Among recipients of ROTARIX, the time of onset after study dose \nranged 3 days to 19 months. \nClinical Trials Comparing the Two ROTARIX Formulations \nThe safety of the ROTARIX liquid formulation was evaluated in 3 randomized clinical studies \n(Studies 9 to 11). A total of 4,223 infants received ROTARIX (liquid formulation, n = 2,507; \nreconstituted lyophilized formulation, n = 1,716). The racial distribution for these studies was as \nfollows: Asian 24.4%, White 63.2%, Black or African American 5.1%, and other 7.3%; 49.7% \nwere male. \nIn Study 10, a concomitant vaccine administration study conducted in United States, 1,272 \ninfants received ROTARIX (liquid formulation, n = 632; reconstituted lyophilized formulation, \nn = 640). The racial distribution for this study was as follows: Asian 3.3%, White 73.8%, Black \nor African American 11.9%, and other 10.9%; 51.5% were male.  \nIn Studies 9 to 11, solicited general adverse reactions (cough/runny nose, diarrhea, fever, \nirritability/fussiness, loss of appetite and vomiting) were recorded by the parent on diary cards \nduring the 8 days after each vaccination (day of vaccination and 7 following days). Unsolicited \nAEs were assessed within 31 days following each vaccination (day of vaccination and 30 \nfollowing days). SAEs were assessed through 6 months after the last dose. \nSolicited Adverse Reactions: In Study 10, solicited adverse reactions among recipients of the two \nROTARIX formulations are presented in the Table 4: \n10 \n \nTable 4.

There were no notable \ndifferences in the occurrence and frequency of unsolicited adverse events between the groups.  \nSerious Adverse Events: During the entire course of Studies 9 to 11, SAEs occurred in 4.7% of \nrecipients of ROTARIX liquid formulation (n = 2,507) as compared with 4.4% of ROTARIX \nreconstituted lyophilized formulation recipients (n = 1,716). \n11 \n \nDuring the entire course of Studies 9 to 11, there was 1 fatal SAE (with diagnosis of sudden \ninfant death syndrome) following administration of ROTARIX liquid formulation (Study 10). \nThe SAE was assessed as not causally related to the vaccination. \nAmong participants in Studies 9 to 11, 2 intussusception cases were reported. One subject from \nStudy 10 experienced intussusception 8 days after receiving the second dose of ROTARIX \n(reconstituted lyophilized formulation). The event was considered possibly related to ROTARIX. \nOne subject from Study 9 experienced intussusception 133 days after receiving the second dose \nof ROTARIX (liquid formulation); the event was not considered related to ROTARIX. Both \nsubjects were hospitalized, and the outcome of intussusception was reported as resolved. \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience  \nThe temporal association between vaccination with ROTARIX and intussusception was \nevaluated in a hospital-based active surveillance study that identified infants with intussusception \nat participating hospitals in Mexico. Using a self-controlled case series method,4 the incidence of \nintussusception during the first 7 days after receipt of ROTARIX and during the 31-day period \nafter receipt of ROTARIX was compared with a control period. The control period was from \nbirth to one year, excluding the pre-defined risk period (first 7 days or first 31 days post-\nvaccination, respectively). \nOver a 2-year period, the participating hospitals provided health services to approximately \n1 million infants under 1 year of age. Among 750 infants with intussusception, the relative \nincidence of intussusception in the 31-day period after the first dose of ROTARIX compared \nwith the control period was 1.96 (95.5% CI: 1.46, 2.63)]; the relative incidence of \nintussusception in the first 7 days after the first dose of ROTARIX compared with the control \nperiod was 6.07 (95.5% CI: 4.20, 8.63). \nThe Mexico study did not take into account all medical conditions that may predispose infants to \nintussusception. The results may not be generalizable to U.S. infants who have a lower \nbackground rate of intussusception than Mexican infants. However, if a temporal increase in the \nrisk for intussusception following ROTARIX similar in magnitude to that observed in the \nMexico study does exist in U.S. infants, it is estimated that approximately 1 to 3 additional cases \nof intussusception hospitalizations would occur per 100,000 vaccinated infants in the U.S. within \n7 days following the first dose of ROTARIX. In the first year of life, the background rate of \nintussusception hospitalizations in the U.S. has been estimated to be approximately 34 per \n100,000 infants.5 \nOther postmarketing observational studies conducted in Brazil and Australia also suggest an \nincreased risk of intussusception within the first 7 days following the second dose of \nROTARIX.2,3 \nWorldwide passive postmarketing surveillance data suggest that most cases of intussusception \nreported following ROTARIX occur in the 7-day period after the first dose. \n12 \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ROTARIX. \nBecause these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not \nalways possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to \nvaccination. \nGastrointestinal Disorders \nIntussusception (including death), recurrent intussusception (including death), hematochezia, \ngastroenteritis with vaccine viral shedding in infants with SCID. \nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders \nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. \nVascular Disorders \nKawasaki disease. \nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \nMaladministration. \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 \nImmunosuppressive Therapies  \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic \ndrugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune \nresponse to ROTARIX. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2).] \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nSafety and effectiveness of ROTARIX in infants younger than 6 weeks or older than 24 weeks of \nage have not been evaluated. \nThe effectiveness of ROTARIX in pre-term infants has not been established. Safety data are \navailable in pre-term infants (ROTARIX = 134, placebo = 120) with a reported gestational age \n36 weeks. These pre-term infants were followed for SAEs up to 30 to 90 days after Dose 2. \nSAEs were observed in 5.2% of recipients of ROTARIX as compared with 5.0% of placebo \nrecipients. No deaths or cases of intussusception were reported in this population. \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nROTARIX (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral), for oral administration, is a live, attenuated rotavirus \nvaccine derived from the human 89-12 strain which belongs to G1P[8] type. The rotavirus \nvaccine strain is propagated on Vero cells. Each 1.5 mL dose contains at least 106.0 CCID50 of \nlive, attenuated rotavirus. \n13 \n \nROTARIX contains disodium adipate, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), sucrose, \nand sterile water. DMEM contains the following ingredients: sodium chloride, potassium \nchloride, magnesium sulfate, ferric (III) nitrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium pyruvate, \nD-glucose, concentrated vitamin solution, L-cystine, L-tyrosine, amino acids solution, L-\nglutamine, calcium chloride, and sodium hydrogenocarbonate. \nROTARIX contains an antacid component (disodium adipate) to protect the vaccine during \npassage through the stomach and prevent its inactivation due to the acidic environment of the \nstomach. \nROTARIX is available in single-dose prefilled squeezable tube [see How Supplied/Storage and \nHandling (16)]. \nROTARIX contains no preservatives. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action  \nThe exact immunologic mechanism by which ROTARIX protects against rotavirus \ngastroenteritis is unknown [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. ROTARIX contains a live, attenuated \nhuman rotavirus that replicates in the small intestine and induces immunity. \n12.2 \nPharmacodynamics  \nShedding and Transmission \nA prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in the \nDominican Republic in twins within the same household to assess whether transmission of \nvaccine virus occurs from a vaccinated infant to a non-vaccinated infant (Study 20; \nNCT00396630). One hundred pairs of healthy twins 6 to 14 weeks of age (gestational age \n32 weeks) were randomized with one twin to receive ROTARIX (n = 100) and the other twin to \nreceive placebo (n = 100). Twenty subjects in each arm were excluded for reasons such as \nhaving rotavirus antibody at baseline. Stool samples were collected on the day of or 1 day prior \nto each dose, as well as 3 times weekly for 6 consecutive weeks after each dose of ROTARIX or \nplacebo. Transmission was defined as presence of the vaccine virus strain in any stool sample \nfrom a twin receiving placebo. \nTransmitted vaccine virus was identified in 15 of 80 twins receiving placebo (18.8% [95% CI: \n10.9, 29.0]). Median duration of the rotavirus shedding was 10 days in twins who received \nROTARIX as compared with 4 days in twins who received placebo in whom the vaccine virus \nwas transmitted. In the 15 twins who received placebo, no gastrointestinal symptoms related to \ntransmitted vaccine virus were observed. \n14 \n \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nROTARIX has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of \nfertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \nThere are two formulations of ROTARIX: a reconstituted lyophilized formulation and a liquid \nformulation. The squeezable tube contains the liquid formulation [see Description (11)]. \nEfficacy was evaluated using the reconstituted lyophilized formulation [see Clinical Studies \n(14.1, 14.2, 14.3)]. These data are relevant to the liquid formulation because both formulations \ncontain the same live, attenuated rotavirus strain and are manufactured using a similar process. \n14.1 \nEfficacy Studies  \nThe data demonstrating the efficacy of ROTARIX in preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis come \nfrom 24,163 infants randomized in two placebo-controlled studies conducted in 17 countries in \nEurope and Latin America (Studies 5 and 8). In these studies, oral polio vaccine (OPV) was not \ncoadministered; however, other routine childhood vaccines could be concomitantly administered. \nBreastfeeding was permitted in both studies. \nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 6 European countries \n(Study 5). A total of 3,994 infants were enrolled to receive ROTARIX (n = 2,646) or placebo \n(n = 1,348). Vaccine or placebo was given to healthy infants as a 2-dose series with the first dose \nadministered orally from 6 through 14 weeks of age followed by one additional dose \nadministered at least 4 weeks after the first dose. The 2-dose series was completed by 24 weeks \nof age. For both vaccination groups, 98.3% of infants were White and 53% were male. \nThe clinical case definition of rotavirus gastroenteritis was an episode of diarrhea (passage of 3 \nor more loose or watery stools within a day), with or without vomiting, where rotavirus was \nidentified in a stool sample. Severity of gastroenteritis was determined by a clinical scoring \nsystem, the Vesikari scale, assessing the duration and intensity of diarrhea and vomiting, the \nintensity of fever, use of rehydration therapy, or hospitalization for each episode. Scores range \nfrom 0 to 20, where higher scores indicate greater severity. An episode of gastroenteritis with a \nscore of 11 or greater was considered severe.6 \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was prevention of any grade of severity of rotavirus \ngastroenteritis caused by naturally occurring rotavirus from 2 weeks after the second dose \nthrough one rotavirus season (according to protocol, ATP). Other efficacy evaluations included \nprevention of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis, as defined by the Vesikari scale, and reductions in \nhospitalizations due to rotavirus gastroenteritis and all-cause gastroenteritis regardless of \npresumed etiology. Analyses were also done to evaluate the efficacy of ROTARIX against \n15 \n \nrotavirus gastroenteritis among infants who received at least one vaccination (total vaccinated \ncohort, TVC). \nEfficacy of ROTARIX against any grade of severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis through one \nrotavirus season was 87.1% (95% CI: 79.6, 92.1); TVC efficacy was 87.3% (95% CI: 80.3, \n92.0). Efficacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis through one rotavirus season was 95.8% \n(95% CI: 89.6, 98.7); TVC efficacy was 96.0% (95% CI: 90.2, 98.8) (Table 5). The protective \neffect of ROTARIX against any grade of severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis observed \nimmediately following Dose 1 administration and prior to Dose 2 was 89.8% (95% CI: 8.9, \n99.8). \nEfficacy of ROTARIX in reducing hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis through one \nrotavirus season was 100% (95% CI: 81.8, 100); TVC efficacy was 100% (95% CI: 81.7, 100) \n(Table 5). ROTARIX reduced hospitalizations for all-cause gastroenteritis regardless of \npresumed etiology by 74.7% (95% CI: 45.5, 88.9). \nTable 5.

A total of 63,225 infants received ROTARIX (n = 31,673) or \nplacebo (n = 31,552). An efficacy subset of these infants consisting of 20,169 infants from Latin \nAmerica received ROTARIX (n = 10,159) or placebo (n = 10,010). Vaccine or placebo was \ngiven to healthy infants as a 2-dose series with the first dose administered orally from 6 through \n13 weeks of age followed by one additional dose administered at least 4 weeks after the first \ndose. The 2-dose series was completed by 24 weeks of age. For both vaccination groups, the \nracial distribution of the efficacy subset was as follows: Hispanic 85.8%, White 7.9%, Black \n1.1%, and other 5.2%; 51% were male. \nThe clinical case definition of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was an episode of diarrhea \n(passage of 3 or more loose or watery stools within a day), with or without vomiting, where \nrotavirus was identified in a stool sample, requiring hospitalization and/or rehydration therapy \nequivalent to World Health Organization (WHO) plan B (oral rehydration therapy) or plan C \n(intravenous rehydration therapy) in a medical facility. \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was prevention of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by \nnaturally occurring rotavirus from 2 weeks after the second dose through one year (ATP). \nAnalyses were done to evaluate the efficacy of ROTARIX against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis \namong infants who received at least one vaccination (TVC). Reduction in hospitalizations due to \nrotavirus gastroenteritis was also evaluated (ATP). \nEfficacy of ROTARIX against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis through one year was 84.7% (95% \nCI: 71.7, 92.4); TVC efficacy was 81.1% (95% CI: 68.5, 89.3) (Table 6). \nEfficacy of ROTARIX in reducing hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis through one year \nwas 85.0% (95% CI: 69.6, 93.5); TVC efficacy was 80.8% (95% CI: 65.7, 90.0) (Table 6). \n17 \n \nTable 6.

Efficacy \nin preventing any grade of severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis cases occurring only during the \nsecond season post-vaccination was 71.9% (95% CI: 61.2, 79.8). The efficacy of ROTARIX \nagainst severe rotavirus gastroenteritis through two rotavirus seasons was 90.4% (95% CI: 85.1, \n94.1). Efficacy in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis cases occurring only during the \nsecond season post-vaccination was 85.6% (95% CI: 75.8, 91.9). \nThe efficacy of ROTARIX in reducing hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis through two \nrotavirus seasons was 96.0% (95% CI: 83.8, 99.5). \nIn the Latin American study (Study 8), the efficacy of ROTARIX against severe rotavirus \ngastroenteritis through two years was 80.5% (95% CI: 71.3, 87.1). Efficacy in preventing severe \nrotavirus gastroenteritis cases occurring only during the second year post-vaccination was 79.0% \n(95% CI: 66.4, 87.4). The efficacy of ROTARIX in reducing hospitalizations for rotavirus \ngastroenteritis through two years was 83.0% (95% CI: 73.1, 89.7). \n18 \n \nThe efficacy of ROTARIX beyond the second season post-vaccination was not evaluated. \n14.3 \nEfficacy against Specific Rotavirus Types  \nThe type-specific efficacy against any grade of severity and severe rotavirus gastroenteritis \ncaused by G1P[8], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8], and combined non-G1 (G2, G3, G4, G9) types was \nstatistically significant through one year. Additionally, type-specific efficacy against any grade \nof severity and severe rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], \nG9P[8], and combined non-G1 (G2, G3, G4, G9) types was statistically significant through two \nyears (Table 7). \nTable 7.

Seroconversion was defined as the appearance \nof anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies (concentration 20 U/mL) post-vaccination in the serum of \ninfants previously negative for rotavirus. \nIn 2 safety and efficacy studies (Studies 5 and 8), one to two months after a 2-dose series, 86.5% \nof 787 recipients of ROTARIX reconstituted lyophilized formulation seroconverted compared \nwith 6.7% of 420 placebo recipients, and 76.8% of 393 recipients of ROTARIX reconstituted \nlyophilized formulation seroconverted compared with 9.7% of 341 placebo recipients, \nrespectively. \nImmunogenicity of a 2-dose series of ROTARIX liquid formulation was evaluated in Study 9. \nThis study compared seroconversion rates and Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs) \nfollowing administration of the ROTARIX liquid formulation (n = 984) or the ROTARIX \nreconstituted lyophilized formulation (n = 329). The primary analyses demonstrated non-\ninferiority of IgA seroconversion rates and GMCs at 1 to 2 months post-vaccination for the \nROTARIX liquid formulation group compared to the ROTARIX reconstituted lyophilized \nformulation group (Lower Limit of the 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates ≥-10%; \nLower Limit of the 95% CI for the GMC ratio ≥0.67). \n20 \n \nIn Study 10, 3 months after a 2-dose series, the percentage of subjects with anti-rotavirus IgA \nantibodies (concentration ≥20 U/mL) was comparable after administration of the ROTARIX \nliquid formulation (76.3% of 417) and the ROTARIX reconstituted lyophilized formulation \n(78.9% of 426). \n14.5 \nConcomitant Vaccine Administration  \nIn clinical trials, ROTARIX was administered concomitantly with U.S.-licensed and non–U.S.-\nlicensed vaccines. In a U.S. concomitant vaccine administration study (Study 18) using \nROTARIX (reconstituted lyophilized formulation) in 484 infants, there was no evidence of \ninterference in the immune responses to any of the antigens when PEDIARIX [Diphtheria and \nTetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis B (Recombinant) and Inactivated \nPoliovirus Vaccine], a U.S.-licensed 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Wyeth \nPharmaceuticals Inc.), and a U.S.-licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur SA) \nwere concomitantly administered with ROTARIX as compared with separate administration of \nROTARIX. \nIn a concomitant vaccine administration study (Study 10) in 1,272 infants, non-inferiority was \ndemonstrated regarding the immune response to each of the antigens in PEDIARIX, HIBERIX \n[Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate)], and a U.S.-licensed, 13-valent \npneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Pfizer Inc.) when concomitantly administered with the \nROTARIX liquid formulation as compared to when concomitantly administered with the \nROTARIX reconstituted lyophilized formulation. \n15 \nREFERENCES  \n1.

Rotavirus can cause diarrhea and vomiting that is so bad that your baby can lose \ntoo much body fluid and need to go to the hospital. \nRotavirus vaccine is a liquid that is given to your baby by mouth. It is not an injection. \nWho should not take ROTARIX? \nYour baby should not get ROTARIX if: \n• \nhe or she has had an allergic reaction after getting a dose of ROTARIX. \n• \nhe or she is allergic to any of the ingredients of this vaccine. A list of ingredients can be found at the \nend of this leaflet. \n• \na doctor has told you that your baby’s digestive system has a defect (is not normal). \n• \nhe or she has a history of a serious problem called intussusception that happens when a part of the \nintestine gets blocked or twisted. \n• \nhe or she has Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID), a severe problem with his/her \nimmune system. \nTell your doctor if your baby: \n• \nhas problems with his/her immune system. \n• \nhas cancer. \n• \nwill be in close contact with someone who has problems with his/her immune system or is getting \ntreated for cancer, as the spread of vaccine virus to non-vaccinated contacts could occur. Hand \nwashing is recommended after diaper changes to help prevent the spread of vaccine virus. \nIf your baby has been having diarrhea and vomiting, your doctor may want to wait before giving your baby \na dose of ROTARIX. \n2 \n \nHow is ROTARIX given?  \nROTARIX is a liquid that is dropped into your baby’s mouth and swallowed. \n \nYour baby will get the first dose at around 6 weeks old. \nThe second dose will be at least 4 weeks after the first dose (before 6 months old). \nBe sure to plan the time for your baby’s second dose with the doctor because it is important that your \nbaby gets both doses of ROTARIX before your baby is 6 months old. \nThe doctor may decide to give your baby other vaccines at the same time as ROTARIX. \nYour baby can be fed normally after getting ROTARIX.  \nWhat are possible side effects of ROTARIX?  \nThe most common side effects of ROTARIX are: \n• \ncrying \n• \nfussiness \n• \ncough \n• \nrunny nose \n• \nfever \n• \nloss of appetite \n• \nvomiting. \nCall your doctor right away or go to the emergency department if your baby has any of these problems \nafter getting ROTARIX, even if it has been several weeks since the last vaccine dose because these may \nbe signs of a serious problem called intussusception: \n• \nbad vomiting \n• \nbad diarrhea \n• \nbloody bowel movement \n• \nhigh fever \n• \nsevere stomach pain (if your baby brings his/her knees to his/her chest while crying or screaming). \nStudies showed an increased risk of intussusception after the first and second dose of vaccine, especially \nin the first 7 days. \nSince FDA approval, reports of infants with intussusception have been received by Vaccine Adverse \nEvent Reporting System (VAERS). Intussusception occurred days and sometimes weeks after \nvaccination. Some infants needed hospitalization, surgery on their intestines, or a special enema to treat \nthis problem. Death due to intussusception has occurred. \n3 \n \nOther reported side effects include: Kawasaki disease (a serious condition that can affect the heart; \nsymptoms may include fever, rash, red eyes, red mouth, swollen glands, swollen hands and feet, and, if \nnot treated, death can occur). \nTalk to your baby’s doctor if your baby has any problems that concern you. \nWhat are the ingredients in ROTARIX?  \nROTARIX contains weakened human rotavirus. \nROTARIX contains disodium adipate, sucrose, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), and sterile \nwater. The ingredients of DMEM are as follows: sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium \nsulphate, ferric (III) nitrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium pyruvate, D-glucose, concentrated \nvitamin solution, L-cystine, L-tyrosine, amino acids solution, L-glutamine, calcium chloride, and sodium \nhydrogenocarbonate. \nROTARIX contains no preservatives. \nThe squeezable tube used to give your baby ROTARIX does not contain latex. \n \n \nManufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals  \nRixensart, Belgium, U.S. License 1617 \nDistributed by GlaxoSmithKline \nDurham, NC 27701 \n \nTrademarks are owned by or licensed to the GSK group of companies. \n©xxxx GSK group of companies or its licensor. \nRTX-ST:1PIL \nThis Patient Information has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration.  \nRevised: \nxx/xxxx  \n \n"

Individuals \naged 12 through 64 years were randomized in a 6:1 ratio, stratified by age stratum (12-17, 18-45, \nand 46-64 years of age), to receive a single dose of VIMKUNYA (n=2,794) or placebo (n=464).  \nAmong the overall 3,258 participants randomized in Study 1, the median age was 38 years [with \n254 (8%) participants 12 through 17 years of age, 1906 (58%) participants 18 through 45 years \nof age, and 1098 (34%) participants 46 through 64 years of age]; 51.2% were female; 73.2% \n4 \n \nwere White, 19.1% Black or African American, 2.9% Asian, 1.0% American Indian or Alaska \nNative, 0.3% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 2.6% multiple racial groups; and 17.7% were \nof Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. \nStudy 2 was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial. Individuals \naged 65 years and older were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by age stratum (65-74 and ≥75 \nyears of age), to receive a single dose of VIMKUNYA (n=206) or placebo (n=207).  \nAmong the overall 413 participants enrolled in Study 2, the median age was 70 years, and 58.6% \nwere female; 83.3% were White, 11.9% Black or African American, 1.2% Asian, 0.5% \nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native, 2.2% multiple racial groups; and 44.3% were of Hispanic or \nLatino ethnicity. \nIn Studies 1 and 2, solicited adverse reactions were collected via electronic diary from the \nvaccination day through 7 days post-vaccination (an 8-day period). Unsolicited adverse events \nwere monitored for 28 days post-vaccination. Serious adverse events were monitored through 6 \nmonths post-vaccination. New onset or worsening arthralgia that was medically attended was \nmonitored through 6 months post-vaccination. \nSolicited Adverse Reactions \nThe percentage of participants in Study 1 reporting solicited local (injection site) and systemic \nadverse reactions is shown in Table 1. In Study 1, the median day of onset was Day 1 for local \nreactions (Day 1 was the day of vaccination) and Day 2 for systemic reactions following \nadministration of VIMKUNYA. Local and systemic adverse reactions resolved with a median \nduration of 1 day. \nTable 1.

There was one report of severe dehydration considered \nrelated to VIMKUNYA.  \nIn Study 2, unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 28 days following vaccination were \nreported in 12.6% of 206 participants who received VIMKUNYA and 15.5% of 207 participants \nwho received placebo. There were no severe unsolicited adverse events considered related to \nVIMKUNYA.  \nMedically Attended New Onset or Worsening Arthralgia \nIn Study 1, 3 (0.1%) participants in the VIMKUNYA group (n=2,790) and 1 (0.2%) participant \nin the placebo group (n=464) reported new onset or worsening arthralgia that was medically \nattended and considered possibly or probably related to VIMKUNYA (beginning 2, 14 and 84 \ndays post-vaccination, respectively) or possibly related to placebo (beginning 1 day post-\nvaccination); none of these reactions were reported as serious or severe (defined as those that \nprevented daily activity and/or required medical intervention).  \n7 \n \nIn Study 2, there were no participants in the VIMKUNYA or placebo groups with new onset or \nworsening arthralgia that was medically attended and considered at least possibly related to the \nstudy intervention. \n8  \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.1  \nPregnancy \nPregnancy Exposure Registry \nThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to \nVIMKUNYA during pregnancy. Women who receive VIMKUNYA during pregnancy are \nencouraged to contact, or have their healthcare provider contact, 1-888-230-2491 to enroll in or \nobtain information about the registry. \nRisk Summary \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general \npopulation, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically \nrecognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.  \nThere are no clinical studies of VIMKUNYA in pregnant women. Data on VIMKUNYA \nadministered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.  \nA developmental toxicity study was performed in female rabbits, administered the equivalent of \na single human dose of VIMKUNYA on 5 occasions, twice prior to mating, twice during \ngestation and once during lactation.  In this study, postnatal survival of the kits was reduced; \nthere were no adverse effects on other postnatal development parameters. There were no adverse \neffects on female fertility; and there was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to the vaccine. A \ndevelopmental toxicity study was performed in female rats administered the equivalent of a \nsingle human dose of VIMKUNYA on 5 occasions, twice prior to mating, twice during gestation \nand once during lactation. In this study there were no adverse effects on postnatal survival and \non other postnatal development parameters. There were no adverse effects on female fertility. \n[see Data].  \nClinical Considerations \nDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk \nVertical transmission of wild-type CHIKV to neonates from pregnant women with viremia at \ndelivery is common and can cause severe, potentially fatal CHIKV disease in neonates, with \nneurologic (e.g., encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage) and myocardial manifestations.1 \n \n \n8 \n \nData \nAnimal Data \nIn a pre- and postnatal developmental study with an embryo-fetal development toxicity phase \nperformed in female rabbits, a full human dose (0.8 mL) of VIMKUNYA was administered by \nintramuscular injection on five occasions: 28 and 14 days prior to start of cohabitation, on \nGestation Days 7 and 21 and on Lactation Day 7. Among kits born in the control group, 69% of \nthe kits [95% confidence interval (CI) (57.8%, 80.1%)] survived compared to the 42% of kits \n[95% CI (31.5%, 52.8%)] born to vaccinated mothers (the historical control data showed a range \nfor postnatal survival from 47.6% to 91.4% with a mean of 71%, from 18 studies); other \npostnatal development parameters were not affected. There were no adverse effects on female \nfertility; and there was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to the vaccine. \nIn a pre- and postnatal developmental study performed in female rats, a full human dose (0.8 \nmL) of VIMKUNYA was administered by intramuscular injection on five occasions: 28 and 14 \ndays prior to start of cohabitation, on Gestation Days 7 and 21 and on Lactation Day 7. No \nvaccine related adverse effects on female fertility or postnatal development were observed. \n8.2  \nLactation \nRisk Summary  \nHuman data are not available to assess the impact of VIMKUNYA on milk production, its \npresence in breast milk, or its effects on the breastfed child. The developmental and health \nbenefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for \nVIMKUNYA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from VIMKUNYA or \nfrom the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying condition is \nsusceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. \n8.4  \nPediatric Use \nThe safety and effectiveness of VIMKUNYA in individuals 12 through 17 years of age are based \non data from this age group and data from adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical \nStudies (14)].  \nThe safety and effectiveness of VIMKUNYA in individuals younger than 12 years of age have \nnot been established. \n8.5  \nGeriatric Use \nIn Study 2, the 206 individuals who received VIMKUNYA were 65 years of age and older; and \namong these, 47 individuals (22.8%) were 75 years of age and older. The incidence of solicited \nadverse reactions in individuals 65 years of age and older was generally lower than that observed \nin individuals less than 65 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The seroresponse rate in \n9 \n \nindividuals 65 years of age and older was lower than that observed in individuals less than 65 \nyears of age [see Clinical Studies (14)].  \n11  \nDESCRIPTION \nVIMKUNYA, Chikungunya Vaccine, Recombinant, is a sterile injectable suspension for \nintramuscular use. VIMKUNYA contains purified virus-like particles (VLPs) consisting of \nCHIKV capsid protein (C) and envelope proteins E1 and E2, derived from CHIKV Senegal \nstrain 37997. The VLPs are produced by transfecting an expression plasmid that encodes for the \nCHIKV structural polyprotein C-E3-E2-6K-E1 in HEK293 (a continuous line of human \nembryonic kidney cells) in media containing amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. The VLPs \ncontaining C, E1 and E2, are harvested from the media and then purified by a series of chemical \nand physical methods. After sterile filtration, the purified VLPs are mixed with formulation \nbuffer and adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] as adjuvant.  \nEach 0.8-mL dose contains approximately 40 mcg of CHIKV VLPs. Each dose also contains 867 \nmcg Al(OH)3 (approximately 300 mcg aluminum), 59.7 mg sucrose, 5.9 mg sodium citrate \ndihydrate, 0.9 mg potassium phosphate dibasic, 0.4 mg potassium phosphate monobasic, and \nwater for injection. Each dose may contain residual amounts of HEK293 cell protein (less than \n400 ng/dose), HEK293 cell DNA (less than 10 ng/dose), poloxamer 188 (less than 2850 \nmcg/dose), polyethyleneimine (less than 4 mcg/dose), valproic acid (less than 12.8 mcg/dose), \nBenzonase (less than 1.6 ng/dose), and plasmid DNA (less than 3.6 ng/dose), from the \nmanufacturing process. \nVIMKUNYA does not contain a preservative or antibiotics. \nThe syringe stoppers and caps are not made with natural rubber latex. \n12  \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1  Mechanism of Action \nThe exact mechanism of protection has not been determined. VIMKUNYA elicits CHIKV-\nspecific immune responses.  \n13  \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nVIMKUNYA has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity, mutagenic \npotential, or for impairment of male fertility in animals.   \n13.2 \nAnimal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology \nA passive transfer study was performed in non-human primates (NHPs) using human anti-\nCHIKV immune sera collected from two Phase 2 studies (NCT03483961 and NCT03992872), \nfrom participants who received a single dose of a vaccine formulation containing the same \nCHIKV VLP used in VIMKUNYA. Sera obtained on Day 22 after vaccination were pooled to \n10 \n \ngenerate a serum pool with a NT80 titer of 2470, as determined by a CHIKV luciferase \nneutralization assay. In the passive transfer study, 20 CHIKV-naïve cynomolgus macaques (M. \nfascicularis) were administered human anti-CHIKV immune sera at four dose levels (2.4, 1.2, \n0.6 and 0.3 mL/kg) and 6 CHIKV-naïve cynomolgus macaques were administered non-immune \ncontrol sera by intravenous injection. One day after the transfers, serum samples were obtained \nfrom the macaques to determine pre-challenge anti-CHIKV neutralizing antibody titers by the \nCHIKV luciferase neutralization assay. On the same day following sera collection, animals were \nchallenged via the subcutaneous route with 100,000 Plaque Forming Units of wild-type CHIKV \nstrain La Réunion 2006-OPY1, corresponding to 1000 times the 50% animal infectious dose. \nAnimal monitoring included assessment of wild-type CHIKV-induced viremia by plaque assay \nand RT-qPCR through 10 days after challenge.  For those NHPs that received anti-CHIKV sera, \nno infectious virus was detected in the blood, and the amounts of CHIKV RNA in the blood were \nreduced in a dose-dependent manner compared with NHPs who received non-immune human \nsera. Data from the NHP study were analyzed by logistic regression and a NT80 titer of ≥100 was \ndetermined to be reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in the Phase 3 studies.  \n \n14  \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \nThe immunogenicity of VIMKUNYA was assessed in Studies 1 and 2 [see Adverse Reactions \n(6.1)]. In both studies, the assessment of effectiveness was based on seroresponse rate at Day 22 \nand the serum neutralizing antibody (SNA) geometric mean titer (GMT) at Day 22. The \nseroresponse rate and GMT 21 days after a single dose of VIMKUNYA in Study 1 is presented \nin Table 3.  \nTable 3.

Prepare SHINGRIX by \nreconstituting the lyophilized varicella zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE) antigen component (powder) with the \naccompanying AS01B adjuvant suspension component (liquid). Use only the supplied adjuvant suspension \ncomponent (liquid) for reconstitution. The reconstituted vaccine should be an opalescent, colorless to pale \nbrownish liquid. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration \nprior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine \nshould not be administered. \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \nFigure 1. Cleanse both \nvial stoppers. Using a \nsterile needle \nappropriate for \nadministering \nSHINGRIX \nintramuscularly and a \nsterile syringe, \nwithdraw the entire \ncontents of the vial \ncontaining the adjuvant \nsuspension component \n(liquid) by slightly \ntilting the vial.

Gently swirl the \nvial until powder is \ncompletely dissolved. Do \nnot shake vigorously. \nFigure 4. After \nreconstitution, withdraw \n0.5 mL from the vial \ncontaining the \nreconstituted vaccine and \nadminister \nintramuscularly. \n \n3\n2.2 \nAdministration Instructions  \nFor intramuscular use. \nAfter reconstitution, administer SHINGRIX immediately or store refrigerated between 2° and 8°C (36° and \n46°F) and use within 6 hours. Discard reconstituted vaccine if not used within 6 hours. \nUse a separate sterile needle and sterile syringe for each individual. The preferred site for intramuscular \ninjection is the deltoid region of the upper arm. \n2.3 \nDose and Schedule  \nTwo doses (0.5 mL each) administered intramuscularly according to the following schedules: \n• A first dose at Month 0 followed by a second dose administered 2 to 6 months later. \n• For individuals who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed and who would benefit from a \nshorter vaccination schedule: A first dose at Month 0 followed by a second dose administered 1 to 2 months \nlater. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nFor injectable suspension. SHINGRIX is supplied as a single-dose vial of lyophilized gE antigen component to \nbe reconstituted with the accompanying vial of AS01B adjuvant suspension component. A single dose after \nreconstitution is 0.5 mL. \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \nDo not administer SHINGRIX to anyone with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any \ncomponent of the vaccine or after a previous dose of SHINGRIX [see Description (11)]. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nPreventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions  \nPrior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the immunization history for possible vaccine \nsensitivity and previous vaccination-related adverse reactions. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision \nmust be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of SHINGRIX. \n5.2 \nGuillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)  \nIn a postmarketing observational study, an increased risk of GBS was observed during the 42 days following \nvaccination with SHINGRIX [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. \n5.3 \nSyncope  \nSyncope (fainting) can be associated with the administration of injectable vaccines, including SHINGRIX. \nSyncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual disturbance, paresthesia, and \ntonic-clonic limb movements. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral \nperfusion following syncope. \n \n4\n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the \nclinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and \nmay not reflect the rates observed in practice. There is the possibility that broad use of SHINGRIX could reveal \nadverse reactions not observed in clinical trials. \nAdults Aged 50 Years and Older \nOverall, 17,041 adults aged 50 years and older received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX in 17 clinical studies. \nThe safety of SHINGRIX was evaluated by pooling data from 2 placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1 \nand 2) involving 29,305 subjects aged 50 years and older who received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX \n(n = 14,645) or saline placebo (n = 14,660) administered according to a 0- and 2-month schedule. At the time of \nvaccination, the mean age of the population was 69 years; 7,286 (25%) subjects were aged 50 through 59 years, \n4,488 (15%) subjects were aged 60 through 69 years, and 17,531 (60%) subjects were aged 70 years and older. \nBoth studies were conducted in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. In the overall \npopulation, the majority of subjects were White (74%), followed by Asian (18%), Black (1.4%), and other \nracial/ethnic groups (6%); 58% were female. \nSolicited Adverse Reactions: In Studies 1 and 2, data on solicited local and general adverse reactions were \ncollected using standardized diary cards for 7 days following each vaccine dose or placebo (i.e., day of \nvaccination and the next 6 days) in a subset of subjects (n = 4,886 receiving SHINGRIX, n = 4,881 receiving \nplacebo with at least 1 documented dose). Across both studies, the percentages of subjects aged 50 years and \nolder reporting each solicited local and general adverse reaction following administration of SHINGRIX (both \ndoses combined) were pain (78%), redness (38%), and swelling (26%); and myalgia (45%), fatigue (45%), \nheadache (38%), shivering (27%), fever (21%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (17%). \nThe reported frequencies of specific solicited local adverse reactions and general adverse reactions (overall per \nsubject), by age group, from the 2 studies are presented in Table 1. \n \n5\nTable 1.

Data for subjects \naged 70 years and older are based on pooled data from Study 1: NCT01165177 and Study 2: NCT01165229. \nc Placebo was a saline solution. \nd Grade 3 pain: Defined as significant pain at rest; prevents normal everyday activities. \ne Grade 3 myalgia, fatigue, headache, shivering, and GI: Defined as preventing normal activity. \nf Fever defined as ≥37.5°C/99.5°F for oral, axillary, or tympanic route, or ≥38°C/100.4°F for rectal route; \nGrade 3 fever defined as >39.0°C/102.2°F. \ng GI = Gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain. \nThe incidence of solicited local and general reactions was lower in subjects aged 70 years and older compared \nwith those aged 50 through 69 years. \nThe local and general adverse reactions seen with SHINGRIX had a median duration of 2 to 3 days. \n \n6\nThere were no differences in the proportions of subjects reporting any or Grade 3 solicited local reactions \nbetween Dose 1 and Dose 2. Headache and shivering were reported more frequently by subjects after Dose 2 \n(28% and 21%, respectively) compared with Dose 1 (24% and 14%, respectively). Grade 3 solicited general \nadverse reactions (headache, shivering, myalgia, and fatigue) were reported more frequently by subjects after \nDose 2 (2.3%, 3%, 4%, and 4%, respectively) compared with Dose 1 (1.4%, 1.4%, 2.3%, and 2.4%, \nrespectively). \nUnsolicited Adverse Events: Unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 30 days following each \nvaccination (Day 0 to 29) were recorded on a diary card by all subjects. In the 2 studies, unsolicited adverse \nevents occurring within 30 days of vaccination were reported in 51% and 32% of subjects who received \nSHINGRIX (n = 14,645) or placebo (n = 14,660), respectively (Total Vaccinated Cohort). Unsolicited adverse \nevents that occurred in ≥1% of recipients of SHINGRIX and at a rate at least 1.5-fold higher than placebo \nincluded chills (4% versus 0.2%), injection site pruritus (2.2% versus 0.2%), malaise (1.7% versus 0.3%), \narthralgia (1.7% versus 1.2%), nausea (1.4% versus 0.5%), and dizziness (1.2% versus 0.8%). \nGout (including gouty arthritis) was reported by 0.18% (n = 27) versus 0.05% (n = 8) of subjects who received \nSHINGRIX or placebo, respectively, within 30 days of vaccination; available information is insufficient to \ndetermine a causal relationship with SHINGRIX. \nSerious Adverse Events (SAEs): In the 2 studies, SAEs were reported at similar rates in subjects who received \nSHINGRIX (2.3%) or placebo (2.2%) from the first administered dose up to 30 days post-last vaccination. \nSAEs were reported for 10.1% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and for 10.4% of subjects who received \nplacebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination. One subject (<0.01%) reported \nlymphadenitis and 1 subject (<0.01%) reported fever greater than 39°C; there was a basis for a causal \nrelationship with SHINGRIX. \nOptic ischemic neuropathy was reported in 3 subjects (0.02%) who received SHINGRIX (all within 50 days \nafter vaccination) and 0 subjects who received placebo; available information is insufficient to determine a \ncausal relationship with SHINGRIX. \nDeaths: From the first administered dose up to 30 days post-last vaccination, deaths were reported for 0.04% of \nsubjects who received SHINGRIX and 0.05% of subjects who received placebo in the 2 studies. From the first \nadministered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination, deaths were reported for 0.8% of subjects who received \nSHINGRIX and for 0.9% of subjects who received placebo. Causes of death among subjects were consistent \nwith those generally reported in adult and elderly populations. \nPotential Immune-Mediated Diseases: In the 2 studies, new onset potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) \nor exacerbation of existing pIMDs were reported for 0.6% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and 0.7% of \nsubjects who received placebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination. The most \nfrequently reported pIMDs occurred with comparable frequencies in the group receiving SHINGRIX and the \nplacebo group. \nDosing Schedule: In an open-label clinical study, 238 subjects aged 50 years and older received SHINGRIX as \na 0- and 2-month or 0- and 6-month schedule. The safety profile of SHINGRIX was similar when administered \naccording to a 0- and 2-month or 0- and 6-month schedule and was consistent with that observed in Studies 1 \nand 2. \n \n7\nImmunocompromised Adults Aged 18 Years and Older \nThe safety of SHINGRIX was evaluated in 6 placebo-controlled clinical studies that enrolled 3,116 subjects \naged 18 years and older from 5 different immunodeficient or immunosuppressed (referred to as \nimmunocompromised) populations, in which a total of 1,587 received SHINGRIX. In all studies, subjects \nreceived Doses 1 and 2 of SHINGRIX 1 to 2 months apart. Safety monitoring for these studies was similar to \nStudies 1 and 2. In addition, subjects were monitored for events relevant to their specific disease or condition. \nAt the time of receipt of SHINGRIX or placebo, the mean age of the population was 55 years; 28% subjects \nwere aged 18 through 49 years and 72% subjects were aged 50 years and older. Each of the studies was \nconducted in one or more of the following regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and \nAustralia/New Zealand. The majority of subjects were White (77%), followed by Asian (17%), Black (2%), and \nother racial groups (3%); 4% were of American Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; 37% were female. \n \n8\nTable 2.

The local and \ngeneral adverse reactions seen with SHINGRIX had a median duration of 1 to 3 days across all studies enrolling \nimmunocompromised subjects. \nUnsolicited Adverse Events: Across all 6 studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects, unsolicited adverse \nevents, including both serious and non-serious events, occurring within 30 days following each vaccination \n \n11 \nwere reported in 46% and 44% of subjects who received SHINGRIX or placebo. Adverse events of arthralgia, \ninfective pneumonia, and influenza-like illness occurred in ≥1% of recipients of SHINGRIX and at a rate at \nleast 1.5-fold higher than placebo (1.5% versus 1.0%, 1.5% versus 0.9%, and 1.3% versus 0.6%, respectively). \nSerious Adverse Events: Across all 6 studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects, SAEs were reported at \nsimilar rates in subjects who received SHINGRIX (7%) or placebo (8%) from the first administered dose up to \n30 days post-last vaccination. SAEs were reported for 26% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and for 27% \nof subjects who received placebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination. SAEs of \ninfective pneumonia were reported for 21 subjects (1.3%) who received SHINGRIX and for 11 subjects (0.7%) \nwho received placebo up to 30 days post-last vaccination. Available information is insufficient to determine a \ncausal relationship to vaccination. \nDeaths: Across all 6 studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects, from the first administered dose up to \n30 days post-last vaccination, deaths were reported for 2 subjects (0.1%) who received SHINGRIX and 7 \nsubjects (0.5%) who received placebo. From the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination, \ndeaths were reported for 6% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and for 6% of subjects who received placebo. \nCauses of death among subjects were consistent with those expected in the populations evaluated. \nPotential Immune-Mediated Diseases: Across all 6 studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects, new onset \npIMDs or exacerbation of existing pIMDs were reported for 1.3% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and \n1.0% of subjects who received placebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination. There \nwere no notable imbalances in specific pIMDs between treatment groups. \nOther Medically Relevant Events: In the auHSCT study (NCT01610414), relapse or progression was reported \nby 315 of 922 subjects (34%) who received at least one dose of SHINGRIX and 331 of 924 subjects (36%) who \nreceived placebo from the first vaccination to study end. \nIn the auHSCT study (NCT00920218), relapse or progression was reported by 17 of 59 subjects (29%) who \nreceived at least one dose of SHINGRIX and 8 of 30 subjects (27%) who received placebo from the first \nvaccination to study end. \nIn the hematologic malignancy study, relapse or progression was reported by 45 of 283 subjects (16%) who \nreceived at least one dose of SHINGRIX and 58 of 279 subjects (21%) who received placebo from the first \nvaccination to study end. \nIn the renal transplant study, biopsy-confirmed allograft rejection was reported by 4 of 132 (3%) of subjects \nwho received SHINGRIX and by 7 of 132 (5%) of subjects who received placebo from the first vaccination to \nstudy end (approximately 13 months later). Creatinine as a measure of graft function and changes in \nalloimmunity post-vaccination were not systematically evaluated. \nIn the HIV study, at least 1 event of worsening HIV condition was reported by 9 of 74 (12%) of subjects who \nreceived SHINGRIX and by 5 of 49 (10%) of subjects who received placebo from the first vaccination to study \nend. \nConcomitant Administration with 23-Valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine \nIn an open-label clinical study (NCT02045836) in subjects aged 50 years and older, information about solicited \nlocal and systemic adverse reactions was collected using diary cards for 7 days (i.e., day of vaccination and the \nnext 6 days). When PNEUMOVAX 23 was concomitantly administered with the first dose of SHINGRIX \ncompared to when the first dose of SHINGRIX was given alone, a greater percentage of subjects reported fever, \n \n12 \ndefined as ≥37.5°C/99.5°F (16% vs. 7%, respectively) and shivering (21% vs. 7%, respectively) [see Clinical \nStudies (14.8)]. \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience  \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of SHINGRIX. Because these \nreactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably \nestimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the vaccine. \nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \nDecreased mobility of the injected arm which may persist for 1 or more weeks. \nImmune System Disorders \nHypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, rash, and urticaria. \nNervous System Disorders \nGuillain-Barré syndrome. \nPostmarketing Observational Study of the Risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome following Vaccination with \nSHINGRIX \nThe association between vaccination with SHINGRIX and GBS was evaluated among Medicare beneficiaries \naged 65 years or older. Using Medicare claims data, from October 2017 through February 2020, vaccinations \nwith SHINGRIX among beneficiaries were identified through National Drug Codes, and potential cases of \nhospitalized GBS among recipients of SHINGRIX were identified through International Classification of \nDiseases codes. \nThe risk of GBS following vaccination with SHINGRIX was assessed in self-controlled case series analyses \nusing a risk window of 1 to 42 days post-vaccination and a control window of 43 to 183 days post-vaccination. \nThe primary analysis (claims-based, all doses) found an increased risk of GBS during the 42 days following \nvaccination with SHINGRIX, with an estimated 3 excess cases of GBS per million doses administered to adults \naged 65 years or older. In secondary analyses, an increased risk of GBS was observed during the 42 days \nfollowing the first dose of SHINGRIX, with an estimated 6 excess cases of GBS per million doses administered \nto adults aged 65 years or older, and no increased risk of GBS was observed following the second dose of \nSHINGRIX. These analyses of GBS diagnoses in claims data were supported by analyses of GBS cases \nconfirmed by medical record review. While the results of this observational study suggest a causal association \nof GBS with SHINGRIX, available evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.1 Pregnancy  \nRisk Summary \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the \nestimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to \n4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The data are insufficient to establish if there is vaccine-associated risk with \nSHINGRIX in pregnant women. \n \n13 \nA developmental toxicity study was performed in female rats administered SHINGRIX or the AS01B adjuvant \nalone prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. The total dose was 0.2 mL on each occasion (a \nsingle human dose of SHINGRIX is 0.5 mL). This study revealed no adverse effects on fetal or pre-weaning \ndevelopment due to SHINGRIX (see Data). \nData \nAnimal Data: In a developmental toxicity study, female rats were administered SHINGRIX or the AS01B \nadjuvant alone by intramuscular injection 28 and 14 days prior to mating, on gestation Days 3, 8, 11, and 15, \nand on lactation Day 7. The total dose was 0.2 mL on each occasion (a single human dose of SHINGRIX is \n0.5 mL). No adverse effects on pre-weaning development up to post-natal Day 25 were observed. There were \nno vaccine-related fetal malformations or variations. \n8.2 \nLactation  \nRisk Summary \nIt is not known whether SHINGRIX is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects of \nSHINGRIX on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. \nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical \nneed for SHINGRIX and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from SHINGRIX or from the \nunderlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to \ndisease prevented by the vaccine. \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nSafety and effectiveness in individuals younger than 18 years have not been established. SHINGRIX is not \nindicated for prevention of primary varicella infection (chickenpox). \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use  \nAdults Aged 60 Years and Older \nOf the total number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX in Studies 1 and 2 (n = 14,645), \n2,243 (15%) were aged 60 through 69 years, 6,837 (47%) were aged 70 through 79 years, and 1,921 (13%) were \naged 80 years and older. There were no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy across the age groups. [See \nClinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.3).] \nThe frequencies of solicited local and general adverse reactions in subjects aged 70 years and older were lower \nthan in younger adults (aged 50 through 69 years). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] \nOf the total number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX in Studies 1 and 2 and were enrolled \ninto the long-term follow-up (LTFU) study (n = 7,408), 1,262 (17%) were aged 60 through 69 years, 3,428 \n(46%) were aged 70 through 79 years, and 642 (9%) were aged 80 years and older at the time of initial \nvaccination. From a median of 5.6 years after vaccination to a median of 11.4 years after vaccination, incidence \nrates of HZ were higher in older age groups (aged 70 through 79 and ≥80 years) compared with younger age \ngroups (aged 50 through 59 and 60 through 69 years). [See Clinical Studies (14.5).] \n \n14 \nImmunocompromised Adults Aged 65 Years and Older \nOf the total number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX in the auHSCT study (n = 922), 172 \n(18.7%) were aged 65 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. There were no clinically meaningful \ndifferences in efficacy between these subjects and younger adults (aged 18 through 64 years). \nOf the total number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX across the 6 studies in \nimmunocompromised subjects (n = 1,587), 337 (21.2%) were aged 65 years and older. The frequencies of \nsolicited local and general adverse reactions in subjects aged 65 years and older were generally similar to or \nlower than those reported by younger adults (aged 18 through 64 years). \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nSHINGRIX (Zoster Vaccine Recombinant, Adjuvanted) is a sterile injectable suspension for intramuscular use. \nThe vaccine is supplied as a vial of lyophilized recombinant varicella zoster virus surface glycoprotein E (gE) \nantigen component, which must be reconstituted at the time of use with the accompanying vial of AS01B \nadjuvant suspension component. The lyophilized gE antigen component is presented in the form of a sterile \nwhite powder. The AS01B adjuvant suspension component is an opalescent, colorless to pale brownish liquid \nsupplied in vials. \nThe gE antigen is obtained by culturing genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, which carry a \ntruncated gE gene, in media containing amino acids, with no albumin, antibiotics, or animal-derived proteins. \nThe gE protein is purified by several chromatographic steps, formulated with excipients, filled into vials, and \nlyophilized. \nThe adjuvant suspension component is AS01B which is composed of 3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid A \n(MPL) from Salmonella minnesota and QS-21, a saponin purified from plant extract Quillaja saponaria Molina, \ncombined in a liposomal formulation. The liposomes are composed of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) \nand cholesterol in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing disodium phosphate anhydrous, potassium \ndihydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, and water for injection. \nAfter reconstitution, each 0.5-mL dose is formulated to contain 50 mcg of the recombinant gE antigen, 50 mcg \nof MPL, and 50 mcg of QS-21. Each dose also contains 20 mg of sucrose (as stabilizer), 4.385 mg of sodium \nchloride, 1 mg of DOPC, 0.54 mg of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.25 mg of cholesterol, 0.160 mg of \nsodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, 0.15 mg of disodium phosphate anhydrous, 0.116 mg of dipotassium \nphosphate, and 0.08 mg of polysorbate 80. After reconstitution, SHINGRIX is a sterile, opalescent, colorless to \npale brownish liquid. \nSHINGRIX does not contain preservatives. Each dose may also contain residual amounts of host cell proteins \n(≤3.0%) and DNA (≤2.1 picograms) from the manufacturing process. \nThe vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action  \nThe risk of developing HZ, which increases with age and with immunosuppression due to disease and/or \ntherapy, appears to be related to a decline in varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific immunity. SHINGRIX was \n \n15 \nshown to boost VZV-specific immune response, which is thought to be the mechanism by which it protects \nagainst zoster disease [see Clinical Studies (14)]. \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nSHINGRIX has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Vaccination of female rats with \nSHINGRIX had no effect on fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. In a male fertility study, rats were \nvaccinated with 0.1 mL of SHINGRIX (a single human dose is 0.5 mL) on 42, 28, and 14 days prior to mating. \nThere were no effects on male fertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \n14.1 \nEfficacy in Subjects Aged 50 Years and Older  \nStudy 1 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical study conducted in 18 countries. \nRandomization was stratified (8:5:3:1) by age: 50 through 59 years, 60 through 69 years, 70 through 79 years, \nand ≥80 years. The study excluded, among others, subjects who were immunocompromised, had a history of \nprevious HZ, were vaccinated against varicella or HZ, and patients whose survival was not expected to be at \nleast 4 years or with conditions that might interfere with study evaluations. Subjects were followed for the \ndevelopment of HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) for a median of 3.1 years (range: 0 to 3.7 years). \nSuspected HZ cases were followed prospectively for the development of PHN, an HZ-related complication \ndefined as HZ-associated pain (rated as 3 or greater on a 0- to 10-point scale by the study subject) occurring or \npersisting at least 90 days following the onset of rash in confirmed cases of HZ. \nThe primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the modified Total Vaccinated Cohort [mTVC]) \nincluded 14,759 subjects aged 50 years and older who received 2 doses (0 and 2 months) of either SHINGRIX \n(n = 7,344) or placebo (n = 7,415) and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the second \ndose. In the mTVC population, 61% were female; 72% were White, 19% were Asian, 1.7% were Black, and 7% \nwere of other racial/ethnic groups. The mean age of subjects was 62.3 years. \nConfirmed HZ cases were determined by either Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (89.4%) or by a Clinical \nEvaluation Committee (10.6%). \nEfficacy against Herpes Zoster \nCompared with placebo, SHINGRIX significantly reduced the risk of developing HZ by 97.2% (95% CI: 93.7, \n99.0) in subjects aged 50 years and older (Table 4). \n \n16 \nTable 4.

With the exception of age, the \nstudy exclusion criteria were the same as for Study 1. Subjects were followed for the development of HZ and \nPHN for a median of 3.9 years (range: 0 to 4.5 years). Suspected HZ cases were followed prospectively for the \ndevelopment of PHN as for Study 1. \nThe primary efficacy analysis population (mTVC) included 13,163 subjects aged 70 years and older who \nreceived 2 doses (0 and 2 months) of either SHINGRIX (n = 6,541) or placebo (n = 6,622) and did not develop \na confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the second dose. In the mTVC population, 55% were female; 78% \nwere White, 17% were Asian, 1% were Black, and 4% were of other racial/ethnic groups. The mean age of \nsubjects was 75.5 years. \nConfirmed HZ cases were determined by either PCR (92.3%) or by a Clinical Evaluation Committee (7.7%). \nEfficacy against Herpes Zoster \nVaccine efficacy results against HZ in subjects aged 70 years and older are shown in Table 5. \n \n17 \nTable 5.

Vaccine efficacy against PHN was 85.5% \n(95% CI: [58.5; 96.3]). The benefit of SHINGRIX in the prevention of PHN can be attributed to the effect of \nthe vaccine on the prevention of HZ. \nReduction of Use of Pain Medication \nAmong subjects with confirmed HZ, the use of HZ-associated pain medications was reported for 10 of 23 \nsubjects (43.5%) who received SHINGRIX and for 160 of 223 subjects (71.7%) who received placebo. \n14.3 \nPooled Efficacy Analyses across Studies 1 and 2  \nThe efficacy of SHINGRIX to prevent HZ and PHN in subjects aged 70 years and older was evaluated by \ncombining the results from Studies 1 and 2 through a pre-specified pooled analysis in the mTVC. A total of \n8,250 and 8,346 subjects who received SHINGRIX and placebo, respectively, were included in the pooled \nmTVC analysis. \nEfficacy against Herpes Zoster \nCompared with placebo, SHINGRIX significantly reduced the risk of developing HZ by 91.3% (95% CI: 86.9, \n94.5) in subjects aged 70 years and older (Table 6). \n \n18 \nTable 6.

The efficacy of SHINGRIX in the prevention of PHN in subjects with confirmed HZ could \nnot be demonstrated. \n14.4 \nImmunological Evaluation to Support Dosing Schedule  \nA measure of the immune response that confers protection against HZ is unknown. Anti-gE antibody levels \nwere measured by anti-gE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gE ELISA) and were used to support the \ndosing schedule. \nIn an open-label clinical study, 238 subjects aged 50 years and older received SHINGRIX on either a 0- and \n2-month or 0- and 6-month schedule. Non-inferiority of the 0- and 6-month schedule compared with the 0- and \n2-month schedule based on anti-gE ELISA GMCs 1 month after the second dose was demonstrated. \n14.5 \nLong-Term Follow-Up Study  \nAn open-label, LTFU study (NCT02723773) was conducted in subjects aged 50 years and older who received \nSHINGRIX in Studies 1 and 2. \nThe primary analysis population (mTVC) included subjects who received 2 doses of SHINGRIX in Studies 1 \nand 2 and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the second dose. The mTVC included \n7,273 subjects who were followed for the occurrence of HZ and PHN starting at a median of 5.6 years \npost-vaccination in Studies 1 and 2 and ending at a median of 11.4 years post-vaccination. Of the 7,273 subjects \nin the mTVC, 2,046 were aged 50 through 59 years (28%), 1,243 (17%) were aged 60 through 69 years, 3,359 \n \n20 \n(46%) were aged 70 through 79 years, and 625 (9%) were aged 80 years or older at the time of initial \nvaccination. Demographic distribution of subjects (by sex, race, and ethnicity) was similar to Studies 1 and 2. \nOf the subjects in the mTVC, 15 subjects who developed HZ in Studies 1 and 2 were excluded from the HZ \nanalysis (n = 7,258 subjects). Among subjects 50 through 59 years, 60 through 69 years, 70 through 79 years, \nand 80 years or older at the time of vaccination, the incidence rates of HZ over the duration of the LTFU study \nwere 1.0, 1.3, 2.3, and 2.5 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. In the LTFU study, the incidence rates by age \ngroup were higher than the incidence rates of HZ reported by age group in the SHINGRIX groups in Study 1 \nand in the pooled analysis of Studies 1 and 2 (which were 0.3, 0.3, 0.8, and 1.0 per 1,000 person-years, \nrespectively [see Tables 4 and 6]). The incidence rates were lower than those reported by age group in the \nplacebo groups in Study 1 and in the pooled analysis of Studies 1 and 2 (which were 7.8, 10.8, 8.9 and 11.1 per \n1,000 person-years, respectively [see Tables 4 and 6]). In Studies 1 and 2, the median follow-up time after \nvaccination was 3.1 and 3.9 years, respectively. \nOf the subjects in the mTVC, 2 subjects who developed PHN in Studies 1 and 2 were excluded from the PHN \nanalysis (n = 7,271 subjects). Over the duration of the LTFU study, 4 cases of PHN were reported in the \nSHINGRIX group. One case was reported in a subject aged 67 years and 3 cases were reported in subjects 70 \nyears or older at the time of vaccination. The incidence rate of PHN among subjects 70 years or older was 0.1 \nper 1,000 person-years. This incidence rate is the same as the incidence rate of PHN reported in the SHINGRIX \ngroup and lower than the incidence rate reported in the placebo group in the pooled analysis of Studies 1 and 2 \n(which was 1.2 per 1,000 person-years [see Table 7]). The benefit of SHINGRIX in the prevention of PHN can \nbe attributed to the effect of the vaccine on the prevention of HZ. \n14.6 \nEfficacy in Immunocompromised Adults Aged 18 Years and Older  \nThe efficacy of SHINGRIX was evaluated in 1 Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical \nstudy in immunocompromised adults aged ≥18 years who received an auHSCT 50 to 70 days prior to Dose 1 \nand who were expected to receive prophylactic antiviral therapy for ≤6 months post-transplant. The efficacy of \nSHINGRIX was calculated post-hoc in another randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study in \nsubjects with hematologic malignancies who received Dose 1 of SHINGRIX or placebo during or within \n6 months of completing immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Each of these studies was conducted in the \nfollowing regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa (auHSCT study only), and \nAustralia/New Zealand. \nEfficacy in Subjects Aged 18 Years and Older: auHSCT Recipients \nIn the auHSCT study, subjects were followed for the development of HZ and PHN for a median of 21 months \n(range: 0 to 49.4 months). Suspected HZ cases were followed prospectively for the development of PHN as in \nStudies 1 and 2. \nThe primary efficacy analysis population (mTVC) for the auHSCT study included 1,721 subjects who received \n2 doses of either SHINGRIX or placebo and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the \nsecond dose. Confirmed HZ cases were determined by either PCR (83.7%) or by a Clinical Evaluation \nCommittee (16.3%). \nEfficacy against Herpes Zoster: Compared with placebo, SHINGRIX significantly reduced the risk of \ndeveloping HZ in auHSCT recipients aged 18 years and older (Table 8). \n \n21 \nTable 8.

Follow-up was censored at the time of treatment for relapse. \nb NCT01610414. \nc Primary study endpoint was based on confirmed HZ cases in subjects aged ≥18 years. \nEfficacy in Subjects Aged 18 Years and Older with Hematologic Malignancies \nIn the study of hematologic malignancies, the mean age was 57 years. The majority of subjects were White \n(71%), followed by Asian (25%), Black (0.4%), and other racial groups (4%); 5% were of American Hispanic \nor Latino ethnicity; and 41% were female. Subjects were followed for the development of HZ for a median of \n11.1 months (range: 0 to 15.6 months). PHN was not assessed as a study endpoint. \nIn the hematologic malignancy study, the population for the post hoc efficacy analysis included 515 subjects \nwho received 2 doses of either SHINGRIX or placebo and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within \n1 month after the second dose. Confirmed HZ cases were determined by either PCR (81.3%) or by a Clinical \nEvaluation Committee (18.7%). The post hoc analysis showed SHINGRIX was 87.2% (95% CI [44.2; 98.6]) \neffective against development of HZ. The incidence rate of HZ per 1,000 person-years was 8.5 versus 66.2 in \nthe SHINGRIX and placebo groups, respectively. \nAdditional Efficacy Endpoints Evaluated in the auHSCT Study \nEfficacy against Postherpetic Neuralgia: In a descriptive analysis, including all subjects aged ≥18 years in the \nmTVC, 1 case of PHN was reported in the vaccine group compared with 9 cases reported in the placebo group. \nVaccine efficacy against PHN was 89.3% (95% CI: [22.5; 99.8]). The benefit of SHINGRIX in the prevention \nof PHN can be attributed to the effect of the vaccine on the prevention of HZ. \nHerpes Zoster-Associated Pain: Subjects with suspected HZ rated their “worst” HZ-associated pain on a \n10-point scale. Among subjects with confirmed HZ, 37 out of 49 subjects (75.5%) receiving SHINGRIX and \n120 out of 135 subjects (88.9%) receiving placebo rated their “worst” HZ-associated pain as 3 or greater. In this \n \n22 \nsubset of subjects, the median duration of “worst” HZ associated pain was 14 and 24 days, among SHINGRIX \nand placebo recipients, respectively. \n14.7 \nRevaccination after Vaccination with ZOSTAVAX (Zoster Vaccine Live)  \nIn an open-label clinical study (NCT02581410), subjects aged 65 years and older, who had been previously \nvaccinated with ZOSTAVAX more than 5 years prior to study enrollment (n = 215) or who had never been \nvaccinated with ZOSTAVAX (n = 215), received 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Months 0 and 2. Subjects who had \nnever been vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX were matched to those who had been previously vaccinated with \nZOSTAVAX according to the predefined variables of age (65 through 69, 70 through 79, and ≥80 years), sex, \nrace/ethnicity, and medical condition (immune-mediated diseases, diabetes mellitus, depression, pulmonary \nconditions, or heart conditions). The mean age was 71 years; 51% were female. All subjects were White and \nwere not Hispanic or Latino. \nThe anti-gE antibody (Ab) concentration measured by ELISA 1 month following 2 doses of SHINGRIX in \nsubjects who had previously been vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX was non-inferior to that of subjects who had \nnever been vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX. The upper limit (UL) of the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.17 \n(success criterion <1.5) for the anti-gE Ab adjusted geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio between \nsubjects who had never been vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX and subjects who had been previously vaccinated \nwith ZOSTAVAX. There was no evidence for interference in the immune response to SHINGRIX in subjects \npreviously vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX. \n14.8 \nConcomitant Administration with Other Vaccines  \nConcomitant Administration with Influenza Vaccine \nIn an open-label clinical study (NCT01954251), subjects aged 50 years and older received 1 dose each of \nSHINGRIX and quadrivalent influenza vaccine (FLUARIX QUADRIVALENT) at Month 0 and 1 dose of \nSHINGRIX at Month 2 (n = 413), or 1 dose of FLUARIX QUADRIVALENT at Month 0 and 1 dose of \nSHINGRIX at Months 2 and 4 (n = 415). The mean age of the population was 63 years; 52% were female. The \nmajority of subjects were White (92%), followed by Asian (6%), and Black (2%); 0.4% were of American \nHispanic or Latino ethnicity. There was no evidence for interference in the immune response to any of the \nantigens contained in SHINGRIX or the coadministered vaccine. \nConcomitant Administration with PNEUMOVAX 23 (Pneumococcal Vaccine Polyvalent) \nIn an open-label clinical study (NCT02045836), subjects aged 50 years and older received 1 dose each of \nSHINGRIX and PNEUMOVAX 23 at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Month 2 (n = 432), or 1 dose of \nPNEUMOVAX 23 at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Months 2 and 4 (n = 433). The mean age of the \npopulation was 63 years; 60% were female. The majority of subjects were White (94%), followed by Black \n(2%), Asian (2%), and other racial groups (2%); 1% were of American Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. \nThe immune response to SHINGRIX, based on anti-gE Ab, was measured by ELISA 1 month after \nadministration of the second dose of SHINGRIX. Immune responses to 12 of the 23 pneumococcal serotypes \ncontained in PNEUMOVAX 23 were measured by multiplex opsonophagocytosis assay (MOPA) at 1 month \nafter administration of the single dose of PNEUMOVAX 23. There was no evidence for interference in the \nimmune response to the antigen contained in SHINGRIX or to the 12 evaluated antigens contained in \nPNEUMOVAX 23 when the two vaccines were administered concomitantly. \n \n23 \nConcomitant Administration with PREVNAR 13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria \nCRM197 Protein]) \nIn an open-label clinical study (NCT03439657), subjects aged 50 years and older received 1 dose each of \nSHINGRIX and PREVNAR 13 at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Month 2 (n = 449), or 1 dose of \nPREVNAR 13 at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Months 2 and 4 (n = 463). The mean age of the \npopulation was 63 years; 60% were female. The majority of subjects were White (98%), followed by Black \n(2%); 0.4% were of American Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. \nThe immune response to SHINGRIX, based on anti-gE Ab, was measured by ELISA 1 month after \nadministration of the second dose of SHINGRIX. Immune responses to the pneumococcal serotypes contained \nin PREVNAR 13 were measured by MOPA at 1 month after administration of the single dose of \nPREVNAR 13. There was no evidence for interference in the immune response to the antigens contained in \nSHINGRIX or PREVNAR 13 when the two vaccines were administered concomitantly. \nConcomitant Administration with BOOSTRIX (Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular \nPertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed) \nIn an open-label clinical study (NCT02052596), subjects aged 50 years and older received 1 dose each of \nSHINGRIX and BOOSTRIX at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Month 2 (n = 412; concomitant \nadministration group), or 1 dose of BOOSTRIX at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Months 2 and 4 \n(n = 418; sequential administration group). The mean age of the population was 63 years; 54% were female. \nThe majority of subjects were White (87%), followed by Black (11%), and other racial groups; 2% were of \nAmerican Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. \nThe immune response to SHINGRIX, based on anti-gE Ab, was measured by ELISA 1 month after \nadministration of the second dose of SHINGRIX. The immune response to BOOSTRIX (anti-D, anti-T, and \nantibodies to pertussis antigens) was measured 1 month after administration of the single dose of BOOSTRIX. \nConcomitant administration showed no evidence for interference in the immune response to the antigen \ncontained in SHINGRIX or the antigens contained in BOOSTRIX, with the exception of one of the pertussis \nantigens (pertactin), which did not meet the non-inferiority criterion: the UL of the 95% CI for the adjusted \nGMC ratio (sequential administration group/concomitant administration group) for anti-pertactin antibody was \n1.58 (non-inferiority criterion <1.5). The clinical significance of the reduced immune response to pertactin is \nunknown. \n16 \nHOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING  \nSHINGRIX is supplied as 2 components: A single-dose vial of lyophilized gE antigen component (powder) and \na single-dose vial of adjuvant suspension component (liquid) (packaged without syringes or needles). \n \n24 \nTable 9.

Pentacel is approved \n4 \nfor use as a four dose series in children 6 weeks through 4 years of age (prior to fifth birthday). \n5 \n2 \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \n6 \n2.1 \nImmunization Series \n7 \nPentacel is to be administered as a 4 dose series at 2, 4, 6 and 15-18 months of age. The first dose \n8 \nmay be given as early as 6 weeks of age. Four doses of Pentacel constitute a primary \n9 \nimmunization course against pertussis. Three doses of Pentacel constitute a primary immunization \n10 \ncourse against diphtheria, tetanus, H. influenzae type b invasive disease, and poliomyelitis; the \n11 \nfourth dose is a booster for diphtheria, tetanus, H. influenzae type b invasive disease, and \n12 \npoliomyelitis immunizations [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5)]. \n13 \nMixed Sequences of Pentacel and DTaP Vaccine \n14 \nWhile Pentacel and DAPTACEL (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis \n15 \nVaccine Adsorbed [DTaP], Sanofi Pasteur Limited) vaccines contain the same pertussis antigens, \n16 \nmanufactured by the same process, Pentacel contains twice the amount of detoxified pertussis \n17 \ntoxin (PT) and four times the amount of filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) as DAPTACEL. \n18 \nPentacel may be used to complete the first 4 doses of the 5-dose DTaP series in infants and \n19 \nchildren who have received 1 or more doses of DAPTACEL and are also scheduled to receive the \n20 \nother antigens of Pentacel. However, data are not available on the safety and immunogenicity of \n21 \nsuch mixed sequences of Pentacel and DAPTACEL for successive doses of the primary DTaP \n22 \nseries. Children who have completed a 4-dose series with Pentacel should receive a fifth dose of \n23 \nDTaP vaccine using DAPTACEL at 4-6 years of age. (1) \n24 \nData are not available on the safety and effectiveness of using mixed sequences of Pentacel and \n25 \nDTaP vaccine from different manufacturers. \n26 \nMixed Sequences of Pentacel and IPV Vaccine \n27 \nPentacel may be used in infants and children who have received 1 or more doses of another \n28 \nlicensed IPV vaccine and are scheduled to receive the antigens of Pentacel. However, data are not \n29 \navailable on the safety and immunogenicity of Pentacel in such infants and children.  \n30 \nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that the final dose in \n31 \nthe 4-dose IPV series be administered at age ≥4 years. (2) When Pentacel is administered at ages \n32 \n2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months, an additional booster dose of IPV vaccine should be administered at \n33 \nage 4-6 years, resulting in a 5-dose IPV series. (2) \n34 \nMixed Sequences of Pentacel and Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine \n35 \nPentacel may be used to complete the vaccination series in infants and children previously \n36 \nvaccinated with one or more doses of Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (either separately \n37 \nadministered or as part of another combination vaccine), who are also scheduled to receive the \n38 \nother antigens of Pentacel. However, data are not available on the safety and immunogenicity of \n39 \nPentacel in such infants and children. If different brands of Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccines \n40 \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n520 – Pentacel® \n \n3 \nare administered to complete the series, three primary immunizing doses are needed, followed by \n41 \na booster dose. \n42 \n2.2 \nAdministration \n43 \nThe package contains a vial of the DTaP-IPV (Vial 1 of 2) component and a vial of lyophilized \n44 \nActHIB (Vial 2 of 2) vaccine component. \n45 \nBefore use, thoroughly but gently shake the vial of DTaP-IPV component, withdraw the entire \n46 \nliquid content and inject into the vial of the lyophilized ActHIB vaccine component. Gently swirl \n47 \nthe vial now containing Pentacel until a cloudy, uniform, white to off-white (yellow tinge) \n48 \nsuspension results.  \n49 \nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration \n50 \nprior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If these conditions exist, Pentacel \n51 \nshould not be administered. \n52 \nWithdraw and administer a single 0.5 mL dose of Pentacel intramuscularly. Pentacel should be \n53 \nused immediately after reconstitution. Discard unused portion. Refer to Figures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. \n54 \n55 \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n520 – Pentacel® \n \n4 \nPentacel: Instructions for Reconstitution of ActHIB Vaccine Component with DTaP-IPV \n56 \nComponent \n57 \n \n58 \nIn infants younger than 1 year, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh provides the largest muscle \n59 \nand is the preferred site of injection. In older children, the deltoid muscle is usually large enough \n60 \nfor injection. The vaccine should not be injected into the gluteal area or areas where there may be \n61 \na major nerve trunk.  \n62 \nDo not administer this product intravenously or subcutaneously. \n63 \nPentacel should not be mixed in the same syringe with other parenteral products. \n64 \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n520 – Pentacel® \n \n5 \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \n65 \nPentacel is a suspension for injection (0.5 mL dose) supplied as a liquid vaccine component that is \n66 \ncombined through reconstitution with a lyophilized vaccine component, both in single-dose vials \n67 \n[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. \n68 \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \n69 \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity \n70 \nA severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of Pentacel or any other \n71 \ndiphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, or pertussis-containing vaccine, inactivated poliovirus vaccine \n72 \nor H. influenzae type b vaccine, or any ingredient of this vaccine is a contraindication to \n73 \nadministration of Pentacel [see Description (11)]. \n74 \n4.2 \nEncephalopathy \n75 \nEncephalopathy (eg, coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) within 7 days of \n76 \na previous dose of a pertussis containing vaccine that is not attributable to another identifiable \n77 \ncause is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing vaccine, including \n78 \nPentacel.  \n79 \n4.3 \nProgressive Neurologic Disorder \n80 \nProgressive neurologic disorder, including infantile spasms, uncontrolled epilepsy, or progressive \n81 \nencephalopathy is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing vaccine \n82 \nincluding Pentacel. Pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with such \n83 \nconditions until a treatment regimen has been established and the condition has stabilized. \n84 \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n85 \n5.1 \nManagement of Acute Allergic Reactions \n86 \nEpinephrine hydrochloride solution (1:1,000) and other appropriate agents and equipment must be \n87 \navailable for immediate use in case an anaphylactic or acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs.  \n88 \n5.2 \nAdverse Reactions Following Prior Pertussis Vaccination \n89 \nIf any of the following events occur within the specified period after administration of a pertussis \n90 \nvaccine, the decision to administer Pentacel should be based on careful consideration of potential \n91 \nbenefits and possible risks. \n92 \n• Temperature of 40.5°C (105°F) within 48 hours, not attributable to another identifiable \n93 \ncause. \n94 \n• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (HHE)) within 48 hours. \n95 \n• Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours within 48 hours. \n96 \n• Seizures with or without fever within 3 days. \n97 \n5.3 \nGuillain-Barré Syndrome and Brachial Neuritis \n98 \nA review by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found evidence for a causal relation between tetanus \n99 \ntoxoid and both brachial neuritis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. (3) If Guillain-Barré syndrome \n100 \noccurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the risk for \n101 \nGuillain-Barré syndrome may be increased following Pentacel.  \n102 \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n520 – Pentacel® \n \n6 \n5.4 \nInfants and Children with a History of Previous Seizures \n103 \nFor infants or children with a history of previous seizures, an appropriate antipyretic may be \n104 \nadministered (in the dosage recommended in its prescribing information) at the time of \n105 \nvaccination with a vaccine containing acellular pertussis antigens (including Pentacel) and for the \n106 \nfollowing 24 hours, to reduce the possibility of post-vaccination fever.  \n107 \n5.5 \nLimitations of Vaccine Effectiveness \n108 \nVaccination with Pentacel may not protect all individuals.  \n109 \n5.6 \nAltered Immunocompetence \n110 \nIf Pentacel is administered to immunocompromised persons, including persons receiving \n111 \nimmunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained [see Drug \n112 \nInteractions (7.2)]. \n113 \n5.7 \nApnea in Premature Infants \n114 \nApnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. \n115 \nThe decision about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including Pentacel, to an infant \n116 \nborn prematurely should be based on consideration of the individual infant’s medical status and \n117 \nthe potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. \n118 \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS \n119 \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience \n120 \nRates of adverse reactions varied by dose number. The most frequent (>50% of participants) \n121 \nsystemic reactions following any dose were fussiness/irritability and inconsolable crying. The \n122 \nmost frequent (>30% of participants) injection site reactions following any dose were tenderness \n123 \nand increased circumference of the injected arm. \n124 \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \n125 \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials \n126 \nof another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction \n127 \ninformation from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events \n128 \nthat appear to be related to vaccine use and for approximating rates of those events. \n129 \nThe poliovirus component (poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3) of this formulation of Pentacel is grown \n130 \nin Vero cells [see Description (11)]. The clinical study data in this section were accrued with a \n131 \nPentacel formulation in which the poliovirus component was grown in MRC-5 cells. The safety of \n132 \nPentacel was evaluated in four clinical studies in which a total of 5,980 participants received at \n133 \nleast one dose of Pentacel. In three of the studies, conducted in the US, a total of 4,198 \n134 \nparticipants were enrolled to receive four consecutive doses of Pentacel. In the fourth study, \n135 \nconducted in Canada, 1,782 participants previously vaccinated with three doses of Pentacel \n136 \nreceived a fourth dose. The vaccination schedules of Pentacel, Control vaccines, and \n137 \nconcomitantly administered vaccines used in these studies are provided in Table 1. \n138 \nAcross the four studies, 50.8% of participants were female. Among participants in the three US \n139 \nstudies, 64.5% were Caucasian, 9.2% were Black, 12.9% were Hispanic, 3.9% were Asian, and \n140 \n9.5% were of other racial/ethnic groups. In the two controlled studies, the racial/ethnic \n141 \ndistribution of participants who received Pentacel and Control vaccines was similar. In the \n142 \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n520 – Pentacel® \n \n7 \nCanadian fourth dose study, 86.0% of participants were Caucasian, 1.9% were Black, 0.8% were \n143 \nHispanic, 4.3% were Asian, 2.0% were East Indian, 0.5% were Native Indian, and 4.5% were of \n144 \nother racial/ethnic groups. \n145 \nTable 1: Clinical Safety Studies of Pentacel: Vaccination Schedules \n146 \nStudy \nPentacel \nControl Vaccines \nConcomitantly Administered Vaccines \n494-01 \n2, 4, 6 and 15 \nmonths \nHCPDT + \nPOLIOVAX + \nActHIB at 2, 4, 6, and \n15 months \n7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine* \n(PCV7) at 2, 4, and 6 months in a subset of \nparticipants† \nHepatitis B vaccine at 2 and 6 months‡ \nP3T06 \n2, 4, 6, and \n15-16 months \nDAPTACEL + IPOL \n+ ActHIB at 2, 4, and \n6 months; and  \nDAPTACEL + \nActHIB at 15-16 \nmonths \nPCV7* at 2, 4, and 6 months \n \nHepatitis B vaccine at 2 and 6 months‡ \n494-03 \n2, 4, 6, and \n15-16 months \nNone \nPCV7* at 2, 4, and 6 months in all \nparticipants; and at 15 months in a random \nsubset of participants \nHepatitis B vaccine at 2 and 6 months (if a \ndose was previously administered) ‡ or at 2, 4, \nand 6 months (if no previous dose)   \nMeasles, mumps, rubella vaccine§ (MMR) \nand varicella§ vaccine at 12 or 15 months in \nrandom subsets of participants \n5A9908 \n15-18 months¶ \nNone \nNone \n \nHCPDT: non-US licensed DTaP vaccine that is identical to the DTaP component of Pentacel. \nPOLIOVAX: US licensed Poliovirus Vaccine Inactivated, Sanofi Pasteur Limited.  \nIPOL: US licensed Poliovirus Vaccine Inactivated, Sanofi Pasteur SA. \n*  PCV7 manufactured by Wyeth Laboratories. \n147 \n†  \nPCV7 was introduced after the study was initiated, and thus, administered concomitantly with Pentacel vaccine \n148 \nin a subset of participants. \n149 \n‡ \nThe first dose of hepatitis B vaccine (manufacturer not specified) was administered prior to study initiation, from \n150 \nbirth to 21 days of age.

In Studies 494-01, \n171 \n494-03, and 5A9908, a question about the occurrence of fainting or change in mental status was \n172 \nasked during post-vaccination phone calls. Across these 4 studies, no HHEs, as defined in a report \n173 \nof a US Public Health Service workshop (4) were reported among participants who received \n174 \nPentacel (N = 5,979), separately administered HCPDT + POLIOVAX + ActHIB (N = 1,032) or \n175 \nseparately administered DAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB (N = 1,455). Hypotonia not fulfilling \n176 \nHHE criteria within 7 days following vaccination was reported in 4 participants after the \n177 \nadministration of Pentacel (1 on the same day as the 1st dose; 3 on the same day as the 3rd dose) \n178 \nand in 1 participant after the administration of DAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB (4 days following \n179 \nthe 1st dose). \n180 \nSeizures \n181 \nAcross Studies 494-01, 494-03, 5A9908 and P3T06, a total of 8 participants experienced a seizure \n182 \nwithin 7 days following either Pentacel (4 participants; N = 4,197 for at least one of Doses 1-3; \n183 \nN = 5,033 for Dose 4), separately administered HCPDT + POLIOVAX + ActHIB (3 participants; \n184 \nN = 1,032 for at least one of Doses 1-3, N = 739 for Dose 4), separately administered \n185 \nDAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB (1 participant; N = 1,455 for at least one of Doses 1-3), or \n186 \nseparately administered DAPTACEL + ActHIB (0 participants; N = 418 for Dose 4). Among the \n187 \nfour participants who experienced a seizure within 7 days following Pentacel, one participant in \n188 \nStudy 494-01 had an afebrile seizure 6 days after the first dose, one participant in Study 494-01 \n189 \nhad a possible seizure the same day as the third dose, and two participants in Study 5A9908 had a \n190 \nfebrile seizure 2 and 4 days, respectively, after the fourth dose. Among the four participants who \n191 \nexperienced a seizure within 7 days following Control vaccines, one participant had an afebrile \n192 \nseizure the same day as the first dose of DAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB, one participant had an \n193 \nafebrile seizure the same day as the second dose of HCPDT + POLIOVAX + ActHIB, and two \n194 \nparticipants had a febrile seizure 6 and 7 days, respectively, after the fourth dose of HCPDT + \n195 \nPOLIOVAX + ActHIB. \n196 \nSerious Adverse Events \n197 \nIn Study P3T06, within 30 days following any of Doses 1-3 of Pentacel or Control vaccines, 19 of \n198 \n484 (3.9%) participants who received Pentacel and 50 of 1,455 (3.4%) participants who received \n199 \nDAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB experienced a serious adverse event.

One case occurred 30 days post-\n216 \nvaccination and was secondary to cardiac arrest following cardiac surgery. One infant who had \n217 \nonset of neurologic symptoms 8 days post-vaccination was subsequently found to have structural \n218 \ncerebral abnormalities and was diagnosed with congenital encephalopathy. \n219 \nA total of 5 deaths occurred during Studies 494-01, 494-03, 5A9908 and P3T06: 4 in children \n220 \nwho had received Pentacel (N = 5,979) and one in a participant who had received DAPTACEL + \n221 \nIPOL + ActHIB (N = 1,455). There were no deaths reported in children who received HCPDT + \n222 \nPOLIOVAX + ActHIB (N = 1,032). Causes of death among children who received Pentacel were \n223 \nasphyxia due to suffocation, head trauma, Sudden Infant Death syndrome, and neuroblastoma (8, \n224 \n23, 52 and 256 days post-vaccination, respectively). One participant with ependymoma died \n225 \nsecondary to aspiration 222 days following DAPTACEL + IPOL + ActHIB. \n226 \n6.2 \nData from Postmarketing Experience \n227 \nThe following additional adverse events have been spontaneously reported during the \n228 \npost-marketing use of Pentacel worldwide, since 1997. Between 1997 and 2007, Pentacel was \n229 \nprimarily used in Canada. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of \n230 \nuncertain size, it may not be possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal \n231 \nrelationship to vaccine exposure.  \n232 \nThe following adverse events were included based on one or more of the following factors: \n233 \nseverity, frequency of reporting, or strength of evidence for a causal relationship to Pentacel.  \n234 \n• Cardiac disorders  \n235 \n \nCyanosis  \n236 \n• Gastrointestinal disorders \n237 \n \nVomiting, diarrhea \n238 \n• General disorders and administration site conditions  \n239 \n \nInjection site reactions (including inflammation, mass, abscess and sterile abscess), \n240 \nextensive swelling of the injected limb (including swelling that involved adjacent joints), \n241 \nvaccination failure/therapeutic response decreased (invasive H. influenzae type b disease)  \n242 \n• Immune system disorders  \n243 \n \nAnaphylaxis/anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity (such as rash and urticaria) \n244 \n• Infections and infestations \n245 \n \nMeningitis, rhinitis, viral infection \n246 \n• Metabolism and nutrition disorders \n247 \n \nDecreased appetite \n248 \n• Nervous system disorders \n249 \n \nSomnolence, HHE, depressed level of consciousness \n250 \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n520 – Pentacel® \n \n12 \n• Psychiatric disorders \n251 \n \nScreaming \n252 \n• Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n253 \n \nApnea, cough \n254 \n• Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \n255 \n \nErythema, skin discoloration \n256 \n• Vascular disorders \n257 \n \nPallor \n258 \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS \n259 \n7.1 \nConcomitant Administration with Other Vaccines \n260 \nIn clinical trials, Pentacel was administered concomitantly with one or more of the following US \n261 \nlicensed vaccines: hepatitis B vaccine, 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, MMR and \n262 \nvaricella vaccines [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14)]. When Pentacel is given \n263 \nat the same time as another injectable vaccine(s), the vaccine(s) should be administered with \n264 \ndifferent syringes and at different injection sites.  \n265 \n7.2 \nImmunosuppressive Treatments \n266 \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic \n267 \ndrugs and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune \n268 \nresponse to Pentacel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].  \n269 \n7.3 \nDrug/Laboratory Test Interactions \n270 \nAntigenuria has been detected in some instances following receipt of ActHIB. Urine antigen \n271 \ndetection may not have definite diagnostic value in suspected H. influenzae type b disease within \n272 \none week following receipt of Pentacel. (5) \n273 \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n274 \n8.4 \nPediatric Use \n275 \nThe safety and effectiveness of Pentacel was established in the age group 6 weeks through 18 \n276 \nmonths on the basis of clinical studies [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1) and Clinical Studies \n277 \n(14)]. The safety and effectiveness of Pentacel in the age group 19 months through 4 years is \n278 \nsupported by evidence in children 6 weeks through 18 months. The safety and effectiveness of \n279 \nPentacel in infants less than 6 weeks of age and in children 5 to 16 years of age have not been \n280 \nestablished. \n281 \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n520  – Pentacel® \n \n13 \n11 \nDESCRIPTION \n282 \nPentacel consists of a Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed and \n283 \nInactivated Poliovirus (DTaP-IPV) component and an ActHIB® component combined through \n284 \nreconstitution for intramuscular injection. ActHIB (Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine [Tetanus \n285 \nToxoid Conjugate]), consists of H. influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide \n286 \n(polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate [PRP]) covalently bound to tetanus toxoid (PRP-T). The DTaP-\n287 \nIPV component is supplied as a sterile liquid used to reconstitute the lyophilized ActHIB \n288 \ncomponent to form Pentacel. Pentacel is a uniform, cloudy, white to off-white (yellow tinge) \n289 \nsuspension.  \n290 \nEach 0.5 mL dose contains 15 Lf diphtheria toxoid, 5 Lf tetanus toxoid, acellular pertussis \n291 \nantigens [20 mcg detoxified pertussis toxin (PT), 20 mcg filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), \n292 \n3 mcg pertactin (PRN), 5 mcg fimbriae types 2 and 3 (FIM)], inactivated polioviruses  \n293 \n[29 D-antigen units (DU) Type 1 (Mahoney), 7 DU Type 2 (MEF-1), 26 DU Type 3 (Saukett)] \n294 \nand 10 mcg PRP of H. influenzae type b covalently bound to 24 mcg of tetanus toxoid (PRP-T). \n295 \nOther ingredients per 0.5 mL dose include 1.5 mg aluminum phosphate (0.33 mg aluminum) as \n296 \nthe adjuvant, <8.1 mcg polysorbate 80, 3.3 mg (0.6% v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol (not as a \n297 \npreservative), 42.5 mg sucrose, 2 mcg to 7 mcg residual formaldehyde, <50 ng residual \n298 \nglutaraldehyde, ≤10 ng residual bovine serum albumin, <0.0001 pg streptomycin sulphate, <0.01 \n299 \npg of neomycin and <0.000001 pg polymyxin B sulphate.  \n300 \nCorynebacterium diphtheriae is grown in modified Mueller’s growth medium. (6) After \n301 \npurification by ammonium sulfate fractionation, the diphtheria toxin is detoxified with \n302 \nformaldehyde and diafiltered.  \n303 \nClostridium tetani is grown in modified Mueller-Miller casamino acid medium without beef \n304 \nheart infusion. (7) Tetanus toxin is detoxified with formaldehyde and purified by ammonium \n305 \nsulfate fractionation and diafiltration. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are individually adsorbed \n306 \nonto aluminum phosphate. \n307 \nThe acellular pertussis vaccine antigens are produced from Bordetella pertussis cultures grown \n308 \nin Stainer-Scholte medium (8) modified by the addition of casamino acids and dimethyl-beta-\n309 \ncyclodextrin. PT, FHA and PRN are isolated separately from the supernatant culture medium.  \n310 \nFIM are extracted and copurified from the bacterial cells. The pertussis antigens are purified by \n311 \nsequential filtration, salt-precipitation, ultrafiltration and chromatography. PT is detoxified with \n312 \nglutaraldehyde. FHA is treated with formaldehyde and the residual aldehydes are removed by \n313 \nultrafiltration. The individual antigens are adsorbed separately onto aluminum phosphate. \n314 \nThe Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 polioviruses are individually grown in Vero cells (a continuous \n315 \nline of monkey kidney cells). Prior to viral propagation, the cells are grown in Iscove’s medium, \n316 \nsupplemented with calf serum. For viral propagation, the culture medium is replaced by M199 \n317 \nmedium without calf serum. The viral harvests are concentrated and purified, then inactivated \n318 \nwith formaldehyde to produce monovalent suspensions of each serotype. Specified quantities of \n319 \nmonovalent suspensions of each serotype are mixed to produce the trivalent poliovirus \n320 \nconcentrate. The adsorbed diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis antigens are combined with \n321 \naluminum phosphate (as adjuvant), 2-phenoxyethanol (not as a preservative) and water for \n322 \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n520  – Pentacel® \n \n14 \ninjection, into an intermediate concentrate. The trivalent poliovirus concentrate is added and the \n323 \nDTaP-IPV component is diluted to its final concentration. The DTaP-IPV component does not \n324 \ncontain a preservative. \n325 \nBoth diphtheria and tetanus toxoids induce at least 2 neutralizing units per mL in the guinea pig \n326 \npotency test. The potency of the acellular pertussis antigens is evaluated by the antibody \n327 \nresponse of immunized mice to detoxified PT, FHA, PRN and FIM as measured by enzyme-\n328 \nlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The potency of inactivated poliovirus antigens is \n329 \ndetermined by measuring antibody-mediated neutralization of poliovirus in sera from immunized \n330 \nrats. \n331 \nPRP, a high molecular weight polymer, is prepared from the Haemophilus influenzae type b \n332 \nstrain 1482 grown in a semi-synthetic medium. (9) The tetanus toxoid for conjugation to PRP is \n333 \nprepared by ammonium sulfate purification, and formalin inactivation of the toxin from cultures \n334 \nof Clostridium tetani (Harvard strain) grown in a modified Mueller and Miller medium. (10) The \n335 \ntoxoid is filter sterilized prior to the conjugation process. The ActHIB component does not \n336 \ncontain a preservative. Potency of the ActHIB component is specified on each lot by limits on \n337 \nthe content of PRP polysaccharide and protein per dose and the proportion of polysaccharide and \n338 \nprotein that is characterized as high molecular weight conjugate.  \n339 \nThe vial stoppers for the DTaP-IPV and ActHIB components of Pentacel are not made with \n340 \nnatural rubber latex. \n341 \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n342 \n12.1 Mechanism of Action \n343 \nDiphtheria  \n344 \nDiphtheria is an acute toxin-mediated disease caused by toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae. \n345 \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to diphtheria \n346 \ntoxin.  A serum diphtheria antitoxin level of 0.01 IU/mL is the lowest level giving some degree \n347 \nof protection. Antitoxin levels of at least 0.1 IU/mL are generally regarded as protective. (11) \n348 \nLevels of 1.0 IU/mL have been associated with long-term protection. (12) \n349 \nTetanus \n350 \nTetanus is an acute disease caused by an extremely potent neurotoxin produced by C. tetani. \n351 \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to tetanus toxin. A \n352 \nserum tetanus antitoxin level of at least 0.01 IU/mL, measured by neutralization assay is \n353 \nconsidered the minimum protective level. (11) (13) A tetanus antitoxoid level ≥0.1 IU/mL as \n354 \nmeasured by the ELISA used in clinical studies of Pentacel is considered protective. \n355 \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n520  – Pentacel® \n \n15 \nPertussis \n356 \nPertussis (whooping cough) is a respiratory disease caused by B. pertussis. This Gram-negative \n357 \ncoccobacillus produces a variety of biologically active components, though their role in either \n358 \nthe pathogenesis of, or immunity to, pertussis has not been clearly defined.  \n359 \nPoliomyelitis \n360 \nPolioviruses, of which there are three serotypes (Types 1, 2, and 3) are enteroviruses. The \n361 \npresence of poliovirus type-specific neutralizing antibodies has been correlated with protection \n362 \nagainst poliomyelitis. (14) \n363 \nInvasive Disease Due to H. influenzae Type b \n364 \nH. influenzae type b can cause invasive disease such as meningitis and sepsis. Anti-PRP antibody \n365 \nhas been shown to correlate with protection against invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b.  \n366 \nBased on data from passive antibody studies (15) and an efficacy study with H. influenzae type b \n367 \npolysaccharide vaccine in Finland, (16) a post-vaccination anti-PRP level of 0.15 mcg/mL has \n368 \nbeen accepted as a minimal protective level. Data from an efficacy study with H. influenzae type \n369 \nb polysaccharide vaccine in Finland indicate that a level >1.0 mcg/mL 3 weeks after vaccination \n370 \npredicts protection through a subsequent one-year period. (17) (18) These levels have been used \n371 \nto evaluate the effectiveness of Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccines, including the ActHIB \n372 \ncomponent of Pentacel.  \n373 \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n374 \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \n375 \nPentacel has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of \n376 \nfertility. \n377 \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES \n378 \nThe efficacy of Pentacel is based on the immunogenicity of the individual antigens compared to \n379 \nseparately administered vaccines. The poliovirus component (poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3) of this \n380 \nformulation of Pentacel is grown in Vero cells [see Description (11)]. The clinical study data in \n381 \nthis section were accrued with a Pentacel formulation in which the poliovirus component was \n382 \ngrown in MRC-5 cells. The poliovirus component of the two Pentacel formulations are \n383 \nanalytically comparable.  Serological correlates of protection exist for diphtheria, tetanus, \n384 \npoliomyelitis, and invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b [see Clinical Pharmacology \n385 \n(12.1)]. The efficacy against pertussis, for which there is no well established serological correlate \n386 \nof protection, was based, in part, on a comparison of pertussis immune responses following \n387 \nPentacel in US children to responses following DAPTACEL (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids \n388 \nand Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (DTaP) manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Limited) in \n389 \nan efficacy study conducted in Sweden (Sweden I Efficacy Trial). While Pentacel and \n390 \nDAPTACEL contain the same pertussis antigens, manufactured by the same process, Pentacel \n391 \ncontains twice as much detoxified PT and four times as much FHA as DAPTACEL. \n392 \nImmune responses to Pentacel were evaluated in four US studies: Studies 494-01, P3T06, 494-\n393 \n03, and M5A10. The vaccination schedules of Pentacel, Control vaccines, and concomitantly \n394 \nadministered vaccines used in Studies 494-01, P3T06, and 494-03 are provided in Table 1 [see \n395 \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n520  – Pentacel® \n \n16 \nClinical Trials Experience (6.1)].

(1) The mean length of follow-\n420 \nup was 2 years after the third dose of vaccine. The protective efficacy of DAPTACEL against \n421 \npertussis after 3 doses of vaccine using the World Health Organization (WHO) case \n422 \ndefinition (21 consecutive days of paroxysmal cough with culture or serologic confirmation or \n423 \nepidemiologic link to a confirmed case) was 84.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 80.1%, \n424 \n88.6%). The protective efficacy of DAPTACEL against mild pertussis (1 day of cough with \n425 \nlaboratory confirmation) was 77.9% (95% CI 72.6%, 82.2%). Protection against pertussis by \n426 \nDAPTACEL was sustained for the 2-year follow-up period.  \n427 \nBased on comparisons of the immune responses to DAPTACEL in US infants (Post-Dose 3) and \n428 \nCanadian children (Post-Dose 4) relative to infants who participated in the Sweden I Efficacy \n429 \nTrial, it was concluded that 4 doses of DAPTACEL were needed for primary immunization \n430 \nagainst pertussis in US children. (1) \n431 \nIn a serology bridging analysis, immune responses to FHA, PRN and FIM in a subset of infants \n432 \nwho received three doses of DAPTACEL in the Sweden I Efficacy Trial were compared to the \n433 \nPost-Dose 3 and Post-Dose 4 responses in a subset of US children from Study 494-01 who \n434 \nreceived Pentacel (Table 4). Available stored sera from infants who received DAPTACEL in the \n435 \nSweden I Efficacy Trial and sera from children who received PCV7 concomitantly with the first \n436 \nthree doses of Pentacel in Study 494-01 (Table 1) were assayed in parallel. Data on levels of \n437 \nantibody to PT using an adequately specific assay were not available for this serology bridging \n438 \nanalysis.  \n439 \nGeometric mean antibody concentrations (GMCs) and seroconversion rates for antibodies to \n440 \nFHA, PRN and FIM one month following Dose 3 of DAPTACEL in the subset of infants from \n441 \nthe Sweden I Efficacy Trial and one month following Dose 3 and Dose 4 of Pentacel in a subset \n442 \nof infants from US Study 494-01 are presented in Table 4. Seroconversion was defined as 4-fold \n443 \nrise in antibody level (Post-Dose 3/Pre-Dose 1 or Post-Dose 4/Pre-Dose 1). For anti-FHA and \n444 \nanti-FIM, the non-inferiority criteria were met for seroconversion rates, and for anti-FHA, anti-\n445 \nPRN, and anti-FIM, the non-inferiority criteria were met for GMCs, following Dose 4 of \n446 \nPentacel relative to Dose 3 of DAPTACEL.

Before reconstitution, each dose of \nVAXCHORA is supplied as a foil packet of buffer and an accompanying foil packet of the active \ncomponent (lyophilized V. cholerae CVD 103-HgR). After reconstitution, a single dose of \nVAXCHORA is 100 mL (50 mL for children 2 through 5 years of age). \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \nDo not use in persons who have a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any \ningredient of VAXCHORA or to a previous dose of any cholera vaccine [see Description (11)]. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n5.1 Altered Immunocompetence \nThe safety and effectiveness of VAXCHORA have not been established in immunocompromised \npersons [see Immunocompromised Individuals (8.6)]. \n5.2 Shedding and Transmission \nVAXCHORA may be shed in the stool of recipients for at least 7 days. There is a potential for \ntransmission of the vaccine strain to non-vaccinated close contacts (e.g., household contacts) \n[see Pharmacodynamics (12.2)]. Use caution when considering whether to administer \nVAXCHORA to individuals with immunocompromised close contacts. \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of \nanother vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nThe most common adverse reactions for adults (incidence > 3%) were tiredness (31%), headache \n(29%), abdominal pain (19%), nausea/vomiting (18%), lack of appetite (17%) and diarrhea (4%). \nThe most common adverse reactions for children and adolescents (incidence ≥10%) were: \n• \nCohort 1 - age 12 to <18 years: headache (45%), tiredness (41%), abdominal pain (38%), \nlack of appetite (29%) and nausea (22%). \n• \nCohort 2 - age 6 to <12 years: tiredness (35%), abdominal pain (27%), headache (26%), \nlack of appetite (15%) and nausea (14%). \n• \nCohort 3 - age 2 to <6 years: tiredness (31%), lack of appetite (19%), and abdominal pain \n(17%). \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience \nTrials in Adults \nThe safety of VAXCHORA was evaluated in four randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter \nclinical trials. A total of 3235 adults 18 through 64 years of age received one dose of \nVAXCHORA and 562 received placebo [physiologic saline (N=551) or lactose (N=11)]. \nOverall, the mean age was 32.5 years; 53.8% of trial participants were female; 67.1% were \nWhite, 27.3% were Black or African American, 1.8% were Asian, 1.7% were multiracial, 1.3% \nwere other, 0.6% were American Indian or Alaskan Native and 0.3% were Native Hawaiian or \nPacific Islander.

Do not administer VAXCHORA to patients \nwho have received oral or parenteral antibiotics within 14 days prior to vaccination. \nAntimalarial Prophylaxis \nData from a study with a similar product indicate that the immune responses to VAXCHORA \nmay be diminished when VAXCHORA is administered concomitantly with chloroquine. \nAdminister VAXCHORA at least 10 days before beginning antimalarial prophylaxis with \nchloroquine. \n7.3 Immunosuppressive Treatments \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic \ndrugs and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune \nresponse to VAXCHORA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n8.1 Pregnancy \nRisk Summary \nVAXCHORA is not absorbed systemically following oral administration, and maternal use is not \nexpected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. \nClinical Considerations \nDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk \nMaternal cholera disease is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including fetal death. \nFetal/neonatal adverse reactions \nThe vaccine strain may be shed in the stool of the vaccinated mother for at least 7 days, with a \npotential for transmission of the vaccine strain from mother to infant during vaginal delivery. \n8.2 Lactation \nRisk Summary \nVAXCHORA is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and \nbreastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to VAXCHORA. \n8.4 Pediatric Use \n9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe safety and effectiveness of VAXCHORA have not been established in children younger than \n2 years of age. \n8.5 Geriatric Use \nThe safety and effectiveness of VAXCHORA have not been established in adults 65 years of age \nor older. \n8.6 Immunocompromised Individuals \nThe safety and effectiveness of VAXCHORA have not been established in immunocompromised \nindividuals.

CVD 103-HgR was \nconstructed from the serogroup O1 classical Inaba strain 569B by deleting the catalytic domain \nsequence of both copies of the ctxA gene, which prevents the synthesis of active cholera toxin \n(CT). This attenuated strain remains able to synthesize the immunogenic non-toxic B subunit of \nCT (encoded by the ctxB gene). In addition, a marker was inserted into the hemolysin gene locus \n(hlyA) to enable differentiation of the vaccine strain from wild type V. cholerae O1. \nThe vaccine strain is grown in fermentors under controlled conditions in medium containing \ncasamino acids, yeast extract, mineral salts, and an anti-foaming agent. The bacteria are \nconcentrated by ultrafiltration before addition of a stabilization solution containing ascorbic acid \n(an antioxidant), Hy-Case SF (hydrolyzed casein [a protein derived from cow’s milk], a \ncryoprotectant), and sucrose (a cryoprotectant). The stabilized bacteria are lyophilized, milled, \nand blended with anhydrous lactose (a bulking agent). The active component blend is filled into \npackets. \nThe buffer component is manufactured by blending together sodium bicarbonate (a gastric acid \nneutralizer), sodium carbonate (a buffer), ascorbic acid (a buffer and water chlorine neutralizer), \nand anhydrous lactose (a manufacturing flow aid). The buffer component blend is filled into \npackets. One buffer component packet and one active component packet are packaged into \nindividual single dose cartons for distribution. \nAfter reconstitution, VAXCHORA contains 4 x 108 to 2 x 109 colony forming units (CFU) of \nlive attenuated V. cholerae CVD 103-HgR. The resulting suspension should be slightly cloudy \nand may contain white particulates. The active and buffer ingredients are shown in Table 3. \n10 \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 3: Vaccine Composition \nActive Component Packet \nIngredient \nV. cholerae CVD 103-HgR \nSucrose \nHy-Case SF (hydrolyzed casein) \nAscorbic acid \nAnhydrous lactose \nActive Component Packet \nQuantity/packet \n4 x 108 to 2 x 109 CFUa \nb\n≤ 165.37 mg\n≤ 17.11 mg \n≤ 8.55 mg \n≤ 2.09 gc \nBuffer Component Packet \nIngredient \nSodium bicarbonate \nSodium carbonate \nAscorbic acid \nAnhydrous lactose \nBuffer Component Packet \nQuantity/packet \n2.16–2.41 g \n0.24-0.49 g \n1.50–1.80 g \n0.18–0.22 g \na CFU=colony forming units. \nb mg=milligrams. \nc g=grams. \n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action \nVAXCHORA contains live attenuated cholera bacteria that replicate in the gastrointestinal tract \nof the recipient. Immune mechanisms conferring protection against cholera following receipt of \nVAXCHORA have not been determined. However, rises in serum vibriocidal antibody 10 days \nafter vaccination with VAXCHORA were associated with protection in a human challenge study \n(Study 2) [see Immunogenicity (14.2)]. \n12.2 \nPharmacodynamics \nShedding of the vaccine strain was evaluated in the first 7 days post-vaccination in a study of 53 \nhealthy adult vaccine recipients (Study 3). VAXCHORA was shed in the stools of 11.3% [95% \nCI 4.3%, 23.0%] of vaccine recipients on any day through 7 days post-vaccination. During the 7 \ndays post-vaccination, the proportion of subjects shedding was highest on day 7 (7.5% [95% CI \n2.1%, 18.2%]). The duration of shedding of the vaccine strain is unknown. \n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nVAXCHORA has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity, \nor to impair fertility. \n14 CLINICAL STUDIES \n14.1 Efficacy Against V. cholerae Challenge \nStudy 2 was a randomized, double-blind, saline placebo-controlled V. cholerae challenge study \nconducted in the US. Subjects 18 through 45 years of age (N=197) with no prior history of \ncholera infection or travel to a cholera-endemic area in the previous 5 years were randomized \naccording to a 1:1 ratio to receive one dose of VAXCHORA or placebo. In order to identify the \n11 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubset of subjects to be challenged, an unblinded statistician prepared four randomly ordered lists \nof subjects per site, one list each for vaccine recipients with blood type O, vaccine recipients \nwith non-O blood types, placebo recipients with blood type O, and placebo recipients with non-O \nblood types. This was done to maintain a minimum of 60% blood group O subjects in each \ntreatment group. Individuals with type O blood are less likely to be infected with V. cholerae, but \nare at risk for developing severe cholera if infected. Each site was provided with a blinded \nversion of the four lists specific to its site and advised on the number of subjects from each list to \nchallenge. In the event that a subject was determined to be ineligible for challenge, the site was \ninstructed to select the next subject from the same list as the ineligible subject. \nThe challenges were split into 2 cohorts for 10 day and 3 month challenges. Subjects were \nadmitted to an inpatient unit. Subjects had nothing by mouth from midnight before ingestion of \nthe challenge strain, except for water, and had nothing by mouth for 90 minutes after ingestion of \nthe challenge strain. Approximately 1 minute prior to challenge, subjects ingested 120 mL \nsodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) buffer. The oral challenge consisted of 1 x 105 CFU live wild \ntype V. cholerae El Tor Inaba N16961 in 30 mL NaHCO3 buffer at 10 days or 3 months post-\nvaccination. The co-primary objectives were to demonstrate the efficacy of a single dose of \nVAXCHORA in the prevention of moderate to severe diarrhea following challenge at 10 days \nand 3 months post-vaccination. Moderate to severe diarrhea was defined as cumulative diarrheal \npurge ≥ 3 liters (L) within 10 days after challenge. Diarrheal stool was defined as ≥ 2 unformed \nstools (takes shape of container) collected during a 48 hour period ≥ 200 grams (g) or a single \nunformed stool ≥ 300 g. Subjects were instructed to collect every stool from the time of \nchallenge until discharge from the inpatient unit. Nursing staff or study personnel inspected all \nstool, graded the consistency of the stool and calculated the total weight of diarrheal stool per \nday. Weight of stool was converted to volume using the formula 1 g=1 mL. VAXCHORA \nrecipients challenged at 10 days post-vaccination and VAXCHORA recipients challenged at 3 \nmonths post-vaccination were compared with a pooled group of placebo (saline) recipients \nchallenged at 10 days or 3 months post-vaccination. \nOf the 95 VAXCHORA recipients, 68 were challenged; 35 were challenged at 10 days post-\nvaccination and 33 were challenged at 3 months post-vaccination. Of the 102 placebo recipients, \n66 were challenged; 33 were challenged at 10 days post-vaccination and 33 at 3 months post-\nvaccination. Among all randomized subjects, the mean age was 31.0 years. Overall, the mean \nage of the challenge population was 31.4 years. More males were in the vaccine group (71.6%) \ncompared to the placebo group (54.9%). The majority of randomized subjects were Black \n(67.5%), 29.4% were White, 0.5% were American Indian/Alaskan Native, 0.5% were Asian, and \n2.0% were other.

The observed risk has been highest in males 12 years through 24 years of \nage. Based on analyses of commercial health insurance claims data from inpatient and outpatient \nsettings, the estimated unadjusted incidence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis during the period \n1 through 7 days following administration of the 2023-2024 Formula of mRNA COVID-19 \nvaccines was approximately 8 cases per million doses in individuals 6 months through 64 years \nof age and approximately 25 cases per million doses in males 12 years through 25 years of age. \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough some individuals with myocarditis and/or pericarditis following administration of \nmRNA COVID-19 vaccines have required intensive care support, available data suggest that \nindividuals typically have resolution of symptoms within a few days with conservative \nmanagement. \nFollow-up information on cardiovascular outcomes in hospitalized patients who had been \ndiagnosed with COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis is available from a longitudinal \nretrospective observational study. Most of these patients had received a two-dose primary series \nof an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine prior to their diagnosis. In this study, at a median follow-up of \napproximately 5 months post-vaccination, persistence of abnormal cardiac magnetic resonance \nimaging (CMR) findings that are a marker for myocardial injury was common. The clinical and \nprognostic significance of these CMR findings is not known1 [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. \nInformation is not yet available about potential long-term sequelae of myocarditis or pericarditis \nfollowing administration of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published considerations related to \nmyocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination, including for vaccination of individuals with a \nhistory of myocarditis or pericarditis (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical­\nconsiderations/myocarditis.html). \n5.3 Syncope \nSyncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines. \nProcedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. \n5.4 Altered Immunocompetence \nImmunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may \nhave a diminished immune response to MNEXSPIKE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. \n5.5 Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness \nMNEXSPIKE may not protect all vaccine recipients. \n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \nMost commonly (≥10%) reported adverse reactions following administration of MNEXSPIKE: \n• Participants 12 years through 17 years of age: pain at the injection site (68.8%), headache \n(54.5%), fatigue (47.3%), myalgia (39.2%), axillary swelling or tenderness (34.6%), \nchills (31.6%), arthralgia (23.9%), and nausea/vomiting (16.1%). \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n• Participants 18 years through 64 years of age: pain at the injection site (74.8%), fatigue \n(54.3%), headache (47.8%), myalgia (41.6%), arthralgia (32.4%), chills (24.3%), axillary \nswelling or tenderness (21.7%), and nausea/vomiting (13.8%). \n• Participants 65 years of age and older: pain at the injection site (54.6%), fatigue (43.0%), \nheadache (33.1%), myalgia (30.5%), arthralgia (25.6%), chills (16.5%), and axillary \nswelling or tenderness (10.7%). \n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nMNEXSPIKE (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) in Participants 12 Years and Older \nThe safety of MNEXSPIKE was evaluated in a randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled \nclinical trial conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada involving 11,417 \nparticipants 12 years of age and older who received a single dose of MNEXSPIKE (n=5,706) or \ncomparator vaccine (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent [Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5] \nnot U.S. licensed, authorized for emergency use; n=5,711) (Study 1, NCT05815498). \nMNEXSPIKE administered in the study contained 5 mcg mRNA encoding the membrane-bound, \nlinked N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) \nglycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu 1 strain (Original) and 5 mcg mRNA encoding the \nmembrane-bound, linked NTD and RBD of the S glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron \nvariant lineages BA.4 and BA.5. The comparator vaccine administered in the study contained 25 \nmcg mRNA encoding the S glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu 1 strain (Original) and \n25 mcg mRNA encoding the S glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant lineages BA.4 \nand BA.5. The median duration of follow-up for safety was 8.8 months. \nIn Study 1, the median age of the population was 56 years (range 12 through 96 years); 8.7% of \nparticipants were 12 years through 17 years, 62.6% were 18 years through 64 years, and 28.7% \nwere 65 years and older. Overall, 45.7% of the participants were male, 54.3% were female, \n13.2% were Hispanic or Latino, 82.2% were White, 11.2% were Black or African American, \n3.6% were Asian, 0.4% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.1% were Native Hawaiian or \nPacific Islander, 0.4% were other races, and 1.5% were Multiracial. Demographic characteristics \nwere similar between participants who received MNEXSPIKE and those who received the \ncomparator vaccine. \nAll participants in the study, except one participant in the MNEXSPIKE group, had previously \nreceived at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine prior to the study with a median interval of 9.8 \nmonths since the last dose. Overall, 74.3% of participants (MNEXSPIKE=4,211; comparator \nvaccine=4,270) had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (immunologic or \nvirologic evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection [defined as positive RT-PCR test and/or \npositive Elecsys immunoassay result at Day 1]). \n5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nSolicited Adverse Reactions \nLocal and systemic adverse reactions and use of antipyretic medication were solicited in an \nelectronic diary for 7 days following injection (i.e., day of vaccination and the next 6 days) \namong participants who received MNEXSPIKE (n=5,702) and participants who received the \ncomparator vaccine (n=5,706).

Of 331 patients, 278 had onset of symptoms \nfollowing the second dose of a primary series, 33 following the first dose of a primary series, and \n20 following a first booster dose1. \nAmong 307 patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis \nfor whom follow-up information was available, 89 reported cardiac symptoms at a median \nfollow-up of 91 days (interquartile range 25-186 days) post-vaccination1. \nInitial gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed on 216 \npatients, of whom 177 had late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), a marker of myocardial injury. \nAmong 161 patients who had LGE on initial CMR and who had a follow-up gadolinium-\nenhanced CMR at a median follow-up of 159 days (interquartile range 78-253 days), 98 had \npersistence of LGE. Overall, the severity of LGE decreased during follow-up. The clinical and \nprognostic significance of these CMR findings is not known1. \nLimitations of this study include potential selection bias towards patients with more severe \n13 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n8 \nmyocarditis who are more likely to be hospitalized and have CMR, variability in diagnostic \ntesting, and variability in follow-up1. \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n8.1 Pregnancy \nRisk Summary \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general \npopulation, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically \nrecognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on \nMNEXSPIKE administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated \nrisks in pregnancy. \nA developmental toxicity study was performed where female rats were administered a vaccine \nformulation containing 80 mcg of nucleoside-modified messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) \n(which is 8 times the amount of nucleoside-modified mRNA in a full human dose of \nMNEXSPIKE [encoding the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of \nthe spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu 1 strain]) twice prior to mating and twice \nduring gestation. The study revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to the vaccine. The \nstudy also revealed no evidence of effects on female fertility (see Animal Data). \nData \nAnimal Data \nA developmental toxicity study was conducted to assess the effects of MNEXSPIKE on \npregnant/lactating female rats, as well as the development of the embryo/fetus and offspring \nfollowing exposure to the female to the vaccine from implantation through the end of pregnancy, \nwith follow-up of the offspring through weaning. In this study, 0.2 mL of a vaccine formulation \ncontaining 80 mcg of nucleoside-modified mRNA per dose (which is 8 times the amount of \nmRNA in a full human dose of MNEXSPIKE [10 mcg of nucleoside-modified mRNA; encoding \nthe N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein \nof SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu 1 strain]). Each dose of the vaccine formulation administered to rats \nalso contained the following ingredients: a total lipid content of 1.8 mg (SM-102, polyethylene \nglycol [PEG] 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol [DMG], cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3­\nphosphocholine [DSPC]), 0.48 mg tromethamine, 17 mg sucrose, and 0.1 mg sodium acetate). \nMNEXSPIKE was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 28 \nand 14 days prior to mating, and on gestation days 1 and 13. No vaccine-related fetal \nmalformations or variations and no adverse effect on postnatal development were observed in the \nstudy.

Data are not available to \nassess the effects of MNEXSPIKE on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. The \ndevelopmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s \nclinical need for MNEXSPIKE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from \nMNEXSPIKE or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the \nunderlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. \n8.4 Pediatric Use \nSafety and effectiveness of MNEXSPIKE in individuals 12 through 17 years of age with at least \none high risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes is based on safety and effectiveness data in \nthis age group and in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14)]. The safety \nand effectiveness of MNEXSPIKE have not been established in individuals younger than 12 \nyears of age. \n8.5  Geriatric Use \nClinical studies of MNEXSPIKE included approximately 1,704 participants 65 years of age and \nolder and 330 participants 75 years of age and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical \nStudies (14)]. \nSome local and systemic adverse reactions were reported in a lower proportion of participants 65 \nyears of age and older compared to participants 18 years through 64 years of age [see Adverse \nReactions (6.1)]. \nRelative vaccine efficacy was similar among participants 65 years of age and older and \nparticipants 18 years through 64 years [see Clinical Studies (14)]. \n8.6 Immunocompromised Individuals \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published considerations related to COVID­\n19 vaccination for individuals who are moderately to severely immunocompromised \n(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html). \n15 \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11 DESCRIPTION \nMNEXSPIKE (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is a sterile white to off-white injectable suspension \nfor intramuscular use. \nEach 0.2 mL dose of MNEXSPIKE (2024-2025 Formula) contains 10 mcg nucleoside-modified \nmessenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain \n(RBD) of the Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant lineage JN.1. Each dose \nalso contains the following ingredients: a total lipid content of 0.2 mg (SM-102, polyethylene \nglycol [PEG] 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol [DMG], cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3­\nphosphocholine [DSPC]), 0.09 mg tromethamine, 0.51 mg tromethamine hydrochloride, and 17 \nmg sucrose. \nMNEXSPIKE does not contain a preservative. \nThe rubber tip cap and plunger used for the single-dose syringes are not made with natural \nrubber latex. \n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n12.1 Mechanism of Action \nThe nucleoside-modified mRNA in MNEXSPIKE is formulated in lipid particles, which enable \ndelivery of the nucleoside-modified mRNA into host cells to allow expression of the N-terminal \ndomain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS­\nCoV-2. The vaccine elicits an immune response which protects against COVID-19. \n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nMNEXSPIKE has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or \nimpairment of male fertility in animals. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. \n14 CLINICAL STUDIES \n14.1 Efficacy of MNEXSPIKE (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) in Participants 12 Years \nof Age and Older \nStudy 1 is a Phase 3 randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the \nrelative vaccine efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of MNEXSPIKE in participants 12 years \nof age and older in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. Randomization was \nstratified by age: 12 years through 17 years, 18 years through 64 years, and 65 years of age and \nolder. The study allowed for the inclusion of participants with stable pre-existing medical \nconditions, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for \nworsening disease during the 2 months before enrollment, as well as participants with stable \n16 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A total of 11,454 participants were randomized \nin a 1:1 ratio to receive MNEXSPIKE (n=5,728), a vaccine encoding the membrane-bound, \nlinked NTD and RBD of the S glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 Original and Omicron variant \nlineages BA.4/BA.5, or comparator vaccine (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent [Original \nand Omicron BA.4/BA.5] not U.S. licensed, authorized for emergency use; n=5,726). All \nparticipants in the study, except one participant in the MNEXSPIKE group, had previously \nreceived at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine prior to the study with a median interval of 9.8 \nmonths since the last dose. \nThe primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per-Protocol Set for Efficacy) \nincluded 11,366 participants who received either MNEXSPIKE (n=5,679) or Moderna COVID­\n19 Vaccine, Bivalent (n=5,687). In the Per-Protocol Set for Efficacy, 45.7% of participants were \nmale, 54.3% were female, 13.1% were Hispanic or Latino, 82.2% were White, 11.1% were \nBlack or African American, 3.6% were Asian, 0.4% were American Indian or Alaska Native, \n0.1% were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 0.3% were other races, and 1.5% were \nMultiracial. The median age of participants was 56 years (range 12 through 96 years) and 28.7% \nof participants were 65 years of age and older. There were no notable differences in \ndemographics between participants who received MNEXSPIKE and those who received the \ncomparator vaccine. \nThe population for the relative vaccine efficacy analysis included participants 12 years of age \nand older who were enrolled from March 28, 2023, and followed for the development of \nCOVID-19 through January 31, 2024. The median length of follow-up was 8 months. \nThe primary efficacy objective in this study was to demonstrate the non-inferior vaccine efficacy \nagainst COVID-19 starting 14 days after MNEXSPIKE compared to that after the comparator \nvaccine. The case definition of COVID-19 was the presence of at least one symptom from a list \nof COVID-19 symptoms and a positive NP swab for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Listed \nsymptoms were fever (temperature ≥38°C / ≥100.4°F) or chills, cough, shortness of breath or \ndifficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle aches or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, \nsore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea.

The median age of participants was 52 years (range 12 through 83 years) and 20.7% of \nparticipants were 65 years of age and older. \nThe primary immunogenicity analyses evaluated the ratio of neutralizing antibody geometric \nmean concentrations (GMC) against a pseudovirus expressing Omicron XBB.1.5 SARS-CoV-2 \nSpike protein following vaccination with MNEXSPIKE compared to vaccination with the \ncomparator vaccine.

IXIARO is approved for use in individuals 2 months of age and older. \n2 \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \nFor intramuscular administration only. \n \n2.1 \nDosage and Schedule \nPrimary Series:  \nChildren 2 months to <3 years of age: Primary immunization with IXIARO consists of two (2) \n0.25 mL doses, administered 28 days apart. \nChildren and adolescents 3 to <18 years of age: Primary immunization with IXIARO consists of \ntwo (2) 0.5 mL doses, administered 28 days apart. \nAdults18 through 65 years of age: Primary immunization with IXIARO consists of two (2) 0.5 mL \ndoses, administered 7 days apart, or two (2) 0.5 mL doses, administered 28 days apart.  \nAdults older than 65 years of age: Primary immunization with IXIARO consists of  two (2) 0.5 \nmL doses, administered 28 days apart.  \nComplete the primary immunization series at least 1 week prior to potential exposure to JEV. \n \nBooster Dose:  \nA booster dose (third dose) may be given at least 11 months after completion of the primary \nimmunization series if ongoing exposure or re-exposure to JEV is expected. \nChildren from 14 months to < 3 years of age should receive a single 0.25 mL booster dose. \nIndividuals 3 years of age and older should receive a single 0.5 mL booster dose.  \n \n2.2 \nAdministration  \nIXIARO is administered intramuscularly. The preferred sites for intramuscular injection are the \nanterolateral aspect of the thigh in infants 2 to 11 months of age, the anterolateral aspect of the \nthigh (or the deltoid muscle if muscle mass is adequate) in children 1 to <3 years of age, or the \ndeltoid muscle in individuals 3 years of age and older. \nDo not administer intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously. \n \n2.3 \nPreparation for Administration \nPrior to agitation, IXIARO is a clear liquid with a white precipitate. Before administration, shake \nthe syringe well to obtain a white, opaque, homogeneous suspension. \nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior \nto administration. If either of these conditions exists, do not administer. \n \nPreparation of a 0.25 mL Dose of IXIARO for Administration to Children 2 Months to <3 Years \nof Age:  \n1. Shake the pre-filled syringe containing 0.5 mL to obtain a homogeneous suspension.  \nVALNEVA AUSTRIA GMBH \n \nIXIARO \n \n \nPage 4 \n \n2. Remove the syringe tip cap by gently twisting it. Do not attempt to snap or pull the tip \noff as this may damage the syringe. \n3. Attach a sterile safety needle to the pre-filled syringe (needle is not provided with \nIXIARO).  \n4. Hold the syringe in an upright position and uncap the needle. \n5. Push the plunger stopper up to the edge of the red line on the syringe barrel, indicated \nby a red arrow (see Figure 1)*, and discard expelled volume into a medical waste \ncontainer. \n6. Lock the needle safety shield and remove the needle. \n7. Attach a new sterile needle prior to injection of the remaining volume. \n \n*If the plunger stopper is pushed beyond the red line, do not administer the vaccine. Repeat the \nprocedure using a new pre-filled syringe.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPreparation of a 0.5 mL Dose of IXIARO for Administration to Individuals 3 Years of Age and \nabove: \n \n1. Shake the pre-filled syringe containing 0.5 mL to obtain a homogeneous suspension.  \n2. Remove the syringe tip cap by gently twisting it. Do not attempt to snap or pull the tip \noff as this may damage the syringe. \n3. Attach a sterile needle to the pre-filled syringe (needle is not provided with IXIARO).  \n \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nIXIARO is a suspension for injection supplied in 0.5 mL single dose syringes. For children 2 \nmonths to <3 years of age, a single dose is 0.25 mL. For individuals 3 years of age and older, a \nsingle dose is 0.5 mL. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)] \n \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \nSevere allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of IXIARO, any other Japanese \nEncephalitis Virus vaccine, or any component of IXIARO, including protamine sulfate, is a \ncontraindication to administration of IXIARO [See Description (11)]. Alternatively, because of \nuncertainty as to which component of the vaccine may be responsible, individuals with a history \nof severe allergic reaction to another Japanese Encephalitis vaccine may be referred to an allergist \nfor evaluation if immunization with IXIARO is considered. \n \nFigure 1:  \nPreparation for \nAdministration of \n0.25 mL Dose \nVALNEVA AUSTRIA GMBH \n \nIXIARO \n \n \nPage 5 \n \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n5.1 \nHypersensitivity Reactions \nIXIARO contains protamine sulfate, a compound known to cause hypersensitivity reactions in \nsome individuals [See Description (11)]. Appropriate medical care should be readily available in \ncase of anaphylactic reaction. \n5.2 \nSyncope \nSyncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines including \nIXIARO. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion \nfollowing syncope. \n5.3 \nLimitations of Vaccine Effectiveness  \nVaccination with IXIARO may not protect all individuals. \n5.4 \nAltered Immunocompetence \nImmunocompromised individuals may have a diminished immune response to IXIARO. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS \nIn infants 2 months to <1 year of age, the most common injection site reaction was redness \n(>15%); the most common solicited systemic adverse reactions were fever (>20%), irritability \n(>15%) and diarrhea (>10%). In children 1 to <3 years of age, the most common solicited \nsystemic adverse reaction was fever (>20%). In children 3 to <12 years of age, the most common \nsolicited systemic adverse reaction was fever (>10%). In adolescents 12 to <18 years of age, the \nmost common solicited injection site reactions were pain (15%) and tenderness (10%). \n \nIn adults 18 years of age and older, the most common injection site reactions were pain (>25%) \nand tenderness (>25%); the most common solicited systemic adverse reactions were headache \n(>20%) and myalgia (>10%). \n \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials \nof another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nClinical Studies in Children and Adolescents 2 Months to <18 Years of Age: \nAdverse Events in a Pediatric Trial of IXIARO Days 0 and 28 Primary Series in a JEV-Endemic \nCountry: \nThe safety of the IXIARO Days 0 and 28 primary series was evaluated in a randomized, \ncontrolled, open-label clinical trial in healthy male and female subjects 2 months to <18 years of \nage, conducted in the Philippines, a country where Japanese Encephalitis is endemic (Study 1)1. \nIXIARO was compared to two control vaccines: HAVRIX (Hepatitis A vaccine, pediatric 720 \nEL.U./0.5 mL formulation, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) and Prevnar (Pneumococcal 7-valent \nConjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 protein], Pfizer). A total of 1,769 subjects were \nrandomized in an age-stratified scheme in a 3:1 ratio (2:1 ratio for ages <1 year) to receive \nintramuscular injections of either IXIARO (two 0.25 mL doses on Days 0 and 28 for infants and \nchildren 2 months to <3 years of age or two 0.5 mL doses on Days 0 and 28 for children 3 to <18 \nyears of age) or HAVRIX (children 1 year of age and older, 2 doses on Day 0 and at Month 7) or \nPrevnar (infants 2 to <6 months of age, 3 doses on Days 0, 28, 56 and an optional 4th dose at \nMonth 7 or later; infants 6 to <12 months of age, 3 doses on Days 0 and 56 and at Month 7).  \nAnalysis of safety for the primary series in children was carried out using the safety population \nincluding 1,311 subjects receiving at least one dose of IXIARO, 394 subjects receiving the first \nVALNEVA AUSTRIA GMBH \n \nIXIARO \n \n \nPage 6 \n \ndose of HAVRIX on Day 0, and 64 subjects receiving at least one dose of Prevnar on Day 0 (all \ninfants <1 year of age). The IXIARO and control groups were similar with regard to demographics \n(mean age 5.48 years, range 2 months to 17 years; 49.5% female; ethnicity: Asian: 100% for \nStudy 11 overall). In both studies, parents or subjects recorded adverse reactions on a diary card \nfor the first seven days after each vaccination.  Only those events considered to be assessable \nbased on the subject’s developmental status were recorded. Parents or subjects were queried \nregarding the occurrence of any unsolicited adverse events following the previous vaccination at \nin-person visits, which included a medical exam, on Day 28, Day 56, and at Month 7 after the \nprimary series.     \nFor an overview of solicited local and systemic reactions following IXIARO Days 0 and 28 \nprimary series vaccinations see Table 1 (infants 2 months to <1 year of age), Table 2 (toddlers 1 to \n<3 years of age) Table 3 (children 3 to <12 years of age), and Table 4 (adolescents 12 to <18 years \nof age).  As children 1 year of age and older received the second dose of HAVRIX at the final \nstudy visit at Month 7, rates of solicited adverse reactions among these subjects after the second \nvaccination are only available for IXIARO.  \nTable 1.

Forty serious adverse \nevents (SAEs) were reported during the 7 month study period. Twenty-three subjects (1.6%) who \nreceived IXIARO, 1 subject (1.6%) who received Prevnar and 10 subjects (2.5%) who received \nHAVRIX experienced an SAE. Some subjects experienced more than one SAE. The SAEs \noccurring most frequently in all study groups were febrile convulsions. A total of 12 febrile \nconvulsions were reported (9 of them as SAEs), in 8 subjects (1.0% of children below the age of 3 \nyears) receiving IXIARO, 3 subjects (1.4% of children below the age of 3 years) receiving \nHAVRIX and 1 subject (1.6%) receiving Prevnar. All febrile convulsions occurred in children \nbelow the age of 3 years. Onset of febrile convulsions ranged from 2 days to >5 months after \ndoses of IXIARO with no apparent temporal clustering, 4 weeks after Prevnar and 9 days to >16 \nweeks after HAVRIX.  \n \nAdverse Events in a Pediatric Trial of IXIARO Days 0 and 28 Primary Series in Children and \nAdolescents Traveling from Non-Endemic Areas:  \nThe safety of the IXIARO Days 0 and 28 primary series was evaluated in an uncontrolled, open-\nlabel clinical trial conducted in the United States, Europe and Australia in healthy children and \nadolescents with planned travel to JEV-endemic areas (Study 2)2. IXIARO (0.25 mL dose for \nVALNEVA AUSTRIA GMBH \n \nIXIARO \n \n \nPage 10 \n \nchildren 2 months to <3 years of age, 0.5 mL dose for children and adolescents 3 to <18 years of \nage) was administered by intramuscular injection on Day 0 and Day 28. Adverse events were \nrecorded as in Study 11. An analysis of safety included 100 subjects (mean age:11.6 years, range 9 \nmonths to <18 years; 53.0% female; race: White: 83.0%, Asian: 13.0%, Black: 3.0%). Solicited \nadverse reactions in Study 22 were generally reported less frequently than in Study 11 and were \ngenerally less frequent following dose 2 compared to dose 1. The most common solicited adverse \nreactions (>10%) following either 0.25 mL dose (N=12) were injection side redness (25%) and \ndiarrhea (17%) and following either 0.5 mL dose (N = 88) were injection site tenderness (50%), \ninjection site pain (25%), muscle pain (31%), and excessive fatigue (11%).  \nAdverse Events in a Pediatric Trial of IXIARO Booster Dose in a JEV Endemic Country:  \nA subset of 300 subjects who completed primary immunization with IXIARO in Study 11 were \nenrolled in an open label follow-on trial (Study 3)3 and randomized 1:1 to receive a single IXIARO \nbooster dose (0.25 mL for ages 14 months to <3 years or 0.5 mL for ages 3 to <18 years) vs. no \nbooster dose at 11 months after completion of the IXIARO primary series. Adverse events were \nrecorded as in Study 11, with follow-up through 24 months after the booster dose. Analysis of \nsafety was carried out using the safety population of 150 subjects (mean age 5.5 years, range 2 \nmonths to  <18  years; 49.5% female race: Asian: 100%). Solicited adverse reactions were \ngenerally reported less frequently following the booster dose than following primary series \nvaccinations. The most common solicited adverse reactions were fever (7%) following the 0.25 \nmL booster dose (N=81) and injection site pain (9%) and fever (9%) following the 0.5 mL booster \ndose (N=67). \n \nClinical Studies in Adults 18 Years of Age and Older: \nOverall, 4,446 healthy adults 18 to 86 years of age received at least one dose of IXIARO and were \nfollowed-up for safety for at least 6 months after the first dose in eight clinical studies 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, \n14 conducted in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. \n \nAdverse Events in a Clinical Trial Comparing IXIARO Days 0 and 28 Primary Series to an \nInactive Control in Adults: \nThe safety of the IXIARO Days 0 and 28 primary series was evaluated in a randomized, \ncontrolled, double-blind clinical trial in healthy male and female subjects ≥18 years of age (Study \n4)4. IXIARO was compared to a control: Phosphate Buffered Saline containing 0.1% aluminum \nhydroxide [PBS + Al(OH)3]. A total of 2,675 subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive \neither an intramuscular injection of IXIARO (0.5 mL) each on Day 0 and Day 28, or an \nintramuscular injection of PBS + Al(OH)3 (0.5 mL) each on Day 0 and Day 28. Analysis of safety \nwas carried out using the safety population including 1,993 subjects receiving at least one dose of \nIXIARO and 657 subjects receiving at least one dose of PBS + Al(OH)3 (mean age: 33.8 years, \nrange 18 to 86 years; 55.3% female; ethnicity: White: 91.7%, Asian: 1.8%, Black: 3.4%, Other: \n3.0%). The IXIARO and control groups were similar with regard to demographics. Subjects \nrecorded adverse events on a diary card for the first seven days after each vaccination. In addition, \nthe study investigator took a medical history and performed a physical exam to evaluate for \nadverse events on the day of each vaccination and at a visit 4 weeks after the second vaccination. \n \nInjection Site Reactions \nInjection site reactions after IXIARO were compared to reactions after PBS + Al(OH)3. Symptoms \nwere recorded into a subject diary for the first seven days after each injection, and the injection \nsite was assessed by the investigator at each visit. The rates of injection site reactions are shown in \nTable 5. Most injection site reactions (>90%) were mild to moderate. \nVALNEVA AUSTRIA GMBH \n \nIXIARO \n \n \nPage 11 \n \nTable 5.

The study revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to IXIARO \n \nClinical Considerations \nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Miscarriages and intrauterine infection \nhave been reported following maternal infection with JEV. \nData \nAnimal data \nIn a developmental toxicity study, female rats were administered IXIARO by intramuscular \ninjection 3 weeks and one week prior to mating and on gestation day 6. The dose was 0.5 mL on \neach occasion (a single human IXIARO dose is 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL). No effects on pre-weaning \ndevelopment up to postnatal day 18 were observed. There were no vaccine-related fetal \nmalformations or variations. \n \n8.2 \nLactation  \nRisk Summary \nIt is not known if IXIARO is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects \nof IXIARO on the breastfed child or on milk production /excretion.  \nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the \nmother’s clinical need for IXIARO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from \nIXIARO or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying \nmaternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine.  \n8.4 \nPediatric Use \nSafety and effectiveness of IXIARO have not been established in infants younger than 2 months of \nage. Safety and effectiveness of IXIARO have been established in the pediatric population 2 \nmonths of age and older [See Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14)]. \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use  \nClinical studies of IXIARO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and \nolder to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In a study that \nincluded 24 subjects ≥65 years of age who received IXIARO per protocol (Study 8)8, the \nproportion of these subjects achieving a JEV neutralizing antibody titer ≥1:10 at 28 days after the \nsecond dose of IXIARO was 95.8% (geometric mean titer: 255.2). \nIn subjects 65 years of age and older who had been vaccinated in any of five trials 4, 5, 8, 12, 14 \nincluded in a pooled dataset (N=161) adverse events were reported in 61.9% (73/118) of subjects \nin the IXIARO group, 57.7% (15/26) in the JE-VAX group, and 70.6% (12/17) in the control \n[PBS + Al(OH)3] group. Serious adverse events (SAE) were experienced by four subjects (3.4%) \nwho received IXIARO, no subjects who received JE-VAX, and one subject (5.9%) who received \nthe control [PBS + Al(OH)3]. None of the SAEs occurring in the IXIARO group were assessed as \nrelated to IXIARO. \n \n11 \nDESCRIPTION \nIXIARO, Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine, Inactivated, Adsorbed is a sterile suspension for \nintramuscular injection. Each 0.5 mL dose of vaccine contains 6 antigen units of purified, \ninactivated JEV and approximately 250 mcg of aluminum hydroxide. The appearance of the liquid \nis a white, opaque, non-uniform suspension which becomes homogeneous upon shaking. \nVALNEVA AUSTRIA GMBH \n \nIXIARO \n \n \nPage 16 \n \nIXIARO is a vaccine prepared by propagating JEV strain SA14-14-2 in Vero cells. Multiple viral \nharvests are pooled, clarified and concentrated. The virus suspension is treated with protamine \nsulfate to remove contaminating DNA and proteins. The resulting partially purified virus is \nprocessed through a sucrose density gradient centrifugation step and fractionated. Each fraction is \nanalyzed for the presence of virus, and fractions with the highest virus activity are pooled to give a \npurified virus suspension. The purified virus is then inactivated by treatment with formaldehyde. \nThe preparation is adjusted to a specified antigen content and formulated by addition of aluminum \nhydroxide.  \nThe formulated bulk vaccine is filled into syringes, at a volume of 0.5 mL per syringe. From the \nmanufacturing process, IXIARO also contains: formaldehyde (not more than 200 ppm), bovine \nserum albumin (not more than 100 ng/mL), host cell DNA (not more than 200 pg/mL), sodium \nmetabisulphite (not more than 200 ppm), host cell protein (not more than 100 ng/mL), and \nprotamine sulfate (not more than 1µg/mL). No preservatives, stabilizers, or antibiotics are added \nto the formulation. \n \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action  \nJapanese encephalitis is a disease caused by the mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). \nIXIARO acts by inducing antibodies that neutralize live JEV. Accumulated data from animal \nstudies, clinical trials of other JE vaccines, and human epidemiological studies, suggest that a \nvirus neutralizing antibody response, as measured in vitro in a 50% plaque-reduction \nneutralization antibody test (PRNT50) with a threshold titer of ≥1:10, provides evidence of \nprotective immunity9, 10. The evaluation of vaccine effectiveness of IXIARO was therefore based \non neutralizing antibody response using a threshold PRNT50 titer of ≥1:10.  \n \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nIXIARO has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. IXIARO was found to \nhave no effect on fertility of female rats [See Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. The effect of \nIXIARO on male fertility has not been evaluated. \n \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES \n14.1 \nImmunogenicity of IXIARO in Children and Adolescents \nImmunogenicity of IXIARO Days 0 and 28 Primary Series in Children and Adolescents from a \nJEV-Endemic Country: \nThe immunogenicity of the IXIARO Days 0 and 28 primary series was evaluated in a subgroup of \nchildren included in a randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial in healthy children \nconducted in the Philippines (Study 1)1 in which the safety of IXIARO was compared to control \nvaccines: HAVRIX (Hepatitis A vaccine, pediatric 720 EL.U./0.5 mL formulation) and Prevnar \n(Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 protein]). Subjects in the \nIXIARO treatment arm received intramuscular doses on Day 0 and Day 28. A total of 396 subjects \nfrom the group receiving an age-appropriate dosage of IXIARO (0.25 mL for infants and children \n2 months to <3 years of age or 0.5 mL for individuals 3 to <18 years of age) were randomized in \nan age-stratified scheme into the immunogenicity subgroup (mean age: 7.7 years; 49.6% female; \nethnicity: 100% Asian).

Subjects with PRNT50 titers <1:10 at 11 months after completion of \nthe primary series received a booster dose of IXIARO 11 months later (22 months after \ncompletion of the primary series). Among 27 subjects with available immunogenicity data at 4 \nweeks after the booster dose, the proportion of subjects with PRNT50 titer ≥1:10 was 100% [95% \nCI 87.5%, 100.0%], and the GMT was 2536.7 [95% CI 1467.7, 4384.4]. \nConcomitant Administration of IXIARO and Hepatitis A Vaccine, HAVRIX in Adults: \nThe concomitant use of IXIARO with inactivated Hepatitis A Virus vaccine (HAVRIX) was \nevaluated in a randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial including 192 healthy adults 18 to \n61 years of age (Study 8)8. Subjects were divided into three treatment groups: Group A (N=62) \nreceived IXIARO (Days 0 and 28) + HAVRIX (Day 0); Group B (N=65) received IXIARO (Days \n0 and 28) + control (0.5 mL phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% aluminum hydroxide by \nintramuscular injection on Day 0); Group C (N=65) received HAVRIX (Day 0) + control (Day 0 \nand 28). Anti-JEV GMT at Day 56 in Group A met non-inferiority criteria compared to anti-JEV \nGMT at Day 56 in Group B. In addition, anti-HAV GMT at Day 28 in Group A met non-\ninferiority criteria compared to anti-HAV GMT at Day 28 in Group C. Therefore, concomitant \nadministration of IXIARO and HAVRIX did not adversely affect immunogenicity compared to \nadministration of either vaccine individually.

If you have any questions about \nIXIARO after reading this leaflet, ask your health care provider. This leaflet does not take the \nplace of talking with your health care professional about IXIARO. Only your health care provider \ncan decide if IXIARO is right for you. \nWhat is IXIARO and how does it work? \n• \nIXIARO is a vaccine for use in individuals 2 months of age and older to help protect \nagainst Japanese encephalitis (JE). You cannot get the disease from IXIARO. \n• \nYou will need 2 doses of the vaccine.  \n• \nYou should consult your health care provider on the need for a booster dose of IXIARO \n• \nYou should still protect yourself from mosquito bites even if you have had the IXIARO \nvaccine. \n• \nIXIARO may not fully protect everyone who gets the vaccine.  \n• \nIXIARO does not protect against encephalitis caused by other viruses/pathogens. \n• \nIXIARO does not protect against other diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. \nWhat is Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and what is the disease caused by JEV? \nJapanese encephalitis (JE) is caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus, JEV, which is mainly \nfound in Asia. JEV is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes that have bitten an infected animal \n(like pigs). Many infected people develop mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. In people who \ndevelop severe disease, JE usually starts as a flu-like illness, with fever, chills, tiredness, \nheadache, nausea, and vomiting. Confusion and agitation also occur in the early stage. JE causes \ndeath in one out of every three people with overt encephalitis. One out of two survivors develops \npermanent brain damage. JE acquired during pregnancy may cause intrauterine infection and \nmiscarriage.   \nWho is at risk for Japanese encephalitis? \n• \nPeople who live in, or travel to, areas where JEV circulates. \n• \nLaboratory personnel who work with JEV. \nWho should not get IXIARO? \nYou should not get IXIARO if you: \n• \nare allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. A list of ingredients can be found at \nthe end of this leaflet. \n• \nhad an allergic reaction after getting a dose of the vaccine or any other JEV vaccine. \nIXIARO is not approved for use in infants below the age of 2 months. \nWhat should I tell my health care professional before I am vaccinated with IXIARO? \nIt is very important to tell your health care provider if you: \n• \nhave had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of IXIARO or any other JEV vaccine. \n• \nhave a bleeding disorder or a reduction in blood platelets, which increases risk of \nbleeding or bruising (thrombocytopenia) and cannot receive injections in the arm. \n• \nhave a weakened immune system, for example, due to a genetic defect or HIV infection. \n• \nare or may be pregnant, or are breast feeding. IXIARO has not been studied in pregnant \nwomen or nursing mothers. \n• \ncurrently have any illness with a fever of more than 100°F (37.8°C). \n• \ntake any medicines, even those you can buy over the counter. \nHow is IXIARO given? \nIXIARO is given as an injection in the upper arm muscle in individuals 3 years of age and older. \nInfants 2 to 11 months of age are given the vaccine into the thigh.  Children 12 to 35 months of \nage may be given the vaccine into the arm muscle (if the muscle is large enough) or into the thigh.  \nVALNEVA AUSTRIA GMBH \n \nIXIARO \n \n \nPage 27 \n \nYou will get a total of 2 doses of the vaccine. All individuals 2 months of age and older can be \nvaccinated as follows. : \n• \nFirst dose: at a date you and your health care provider choose. \n• \nSecond dose: 28 days after the first dose. \nAdults  18 to 65 years of age  can also be vaccinated as follows: \n• \nFirst dose: at a date you and your health care provider choose.  \n• \nSecond dose: 7 days after the first dose.  \n \nMake sure that you get both doses. If you miss the second dose, your health care provider will \ndecide when to give the missed dose. Be aware that protection is not reliable until 1 week after \nyou receive the second dose of IXIARO. \nIf the second dose was administered more than 1 year ago, you should consult your health care \nprovider on the need for a booster dose of IXIARO prior to potential re-exposure to JEV.  \nWhat are the possible side effects of IXIARO? \nThe most common side effects in adolescents >12 years of age and adults are headache, muscle \npain and injection site reactions (e.g. pain, swelling, tenderness, redness). Nausea, skin rash, \nfatigue, flu-like illness, fever, irritability and loss of appetite may also occur.   \nThe most common side effects in children below the age of 12 years are fever, irritability, \ndiarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite, injection site pain and injection site redness. \nContact your health care provider right away if you get any symptoms after receiving IXIARO \nthat concern you. \nTell your health care provider if you have any of the following problems because these may be \nsigns of an allergic reaction: \n• \ndifficulty breathing  \n• \nhoarseness or wheezing  \n• \nhives  \n• \ndizziness, weakness or fast heart beat  \nWhat are the ingredients of IXIARO? \nActive Ingredient:  purified inactivated Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). \nInactive Ingredients:  aluminum hydroxide and phosphate buffered saline (sodium chloride, \npotassium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate). \nMinute amounts of other substances remain in the vaccine as a result of the manufacturing \nprocess. Refer to the package insert for a complete list. \nWhat else should I know about IXIARO? \nThis leaflet is a summary of information about IXIARO. If you would like more information, \nplease talk to your health care professional. U.S. and international agencies (such as cdc.gov and \nwho.int) also provide additional information about JEV and related travel advisories. \nIssued September 2018 \n \nLicense Holder: \nValneva Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria \nManufacturer: \nValneva Scotland Ltd., Livingston, UK \nand  \nDistributed by:  \nValneva USA, Inc. \nGaithersburg, MD 20878 \nUSA \n"

A single dose of Quadracel is approved for use as a fifth dose in the \ndiphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTaP) vaccination series, and as a fourth or fifth dose in the \ninactivated poliovirus (IPV) vaccination series in children 4 through 6 years of age whose \nprevious DTaP vaccine doses have been with Pentacel® [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and \nAcellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed, Inactivated Poliovirus and Haemophilus b conjugate \n(Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate) Vaccine], DAPTACEL® (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and \nAcellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed) and/or VAXELIS (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and \nAcellular Pertussis, Inactivated Poliovirus, Haemophilus b Conjugate and Hepatitis B Vaccine). \n   \n2 \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  \nFor intramuscular injection only. \nJust before use, shake the vial well, until a uniform, white, cloudy suspension results. Parenteral \ndrug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to \nadministration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exist, the \nproduct should not be administered.  \nWithdraw and administer a 0.5 mL dose of Quadracel vaccine intramuscularly into the deltoid \nmuscle of the upper arm. Discard unused portion. \nQuadracel should not be combined through reconstitution or mixed with any other vaccine.  \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nQuadracel is a suspension for injection in 0.5 mL single-dose vials.  \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity  \nSevere allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ingredient of Quadracel [see Description (11)] \nor following any diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis-containing vaccine, or inactivated \npoliovirus vaccine, is a contraindication to administration of Quadracel.  \n4.2 \nEncephalopathy  \nEncephalopathy (e.g., coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) within 7 days \nof a previous dose of a pertussis-containing vaccine that is not attributable to another identifiable \ncause is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing vaccine, including \nQuadracel.  \n4.3 \nProgressive Neurologic Disorder  \nProgressive neurologic disorder, including infantile spasms, uncontrolled epilepsy, or \nprogressive encephalopathy is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n521 – Quadracel® \n \n3 \nvaccine including Quadracel. Pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with \nsuch conditions until a treatment regimen has been established and the condition has stabilized. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nManagement of Acute Allergic Reactions  \nEpinephrine hydrochloride solution (1:1,000) and other appropriate agents and equipment must \nbe available for immediate use in case an anaphylactic or acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs.  \n5.2 \nAdverse Reactions Following Prior Pertussis Vaccination  \nIf any of the following events have occurred within the specified period after administration of a \npertussis vaccine, the decision to administer Quadracel should be based on careful consideration \nof benefits and risks. \n• Temperature of 40.5°C (105°F) within 48 hours, not attributable to another identifiable \ncause. \n• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode [HHE]) within 48 hours. \n• Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours within 48 hours. \n• Seizures with or without fever within 3 days. \n5.3 \nGuillain-Barré Syndrome  \nIf Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing \ntetanus toxoid, the decision to give any vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, including Quadracel, \nshould be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks.  \n5.4 \nLimitations of Vaccine Effectiveness  \nVaccination with Quadracel may not protect all individuals.  \n5.5 \nAltered Immunocompetence  \nIf Quadracel is administered to immunocompromised persons, including persons receiving \nimmunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained [see Drug \nInteractions (7.2)]. \n5.6 \nSyncope  \nSyncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines including \nQuadracel . Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \nIn a clinical study, the most common solicited injection site reactions were pain (>75%), increase \nin arm circumference (>65%), erythema (>55%), and swelling (>40%). Common solicited \nsystemic reactions were myalgia (>50%), malaise (>35%), and headache (>15%). \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n521 – Quadracel® \n \n4 \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction \ninformation from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events \nthat appear to be related to vaccine use and for approximating rates of those events. The \npoliovirus component (poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3) of this formulation of Quadracel is grown in \nVero cells [see Description (11)].The clinical study data in this section were accrued with a \nQuadracel formulation in which poliovirus component was grown in MRC-5 cells.  \nIn a randomized, controlled, multicenter study conducted in the US and Puerto Rico (Study \nM5I02; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01346293), 3,372 children, 4 to 6 years of age, who \nhad received 4 doses of DAPTACEL and/or Pentacel vaccine(s) received Quadracel, or \nDAPTACEL + IPOL (Poliovirus Vaccine Inactivated) vaccines administered concomitantly but \nat separate sites. Subjects also received Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live \n(MMR) (Merck & Co., Inc.) and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live (Varicella vaccine) (Merck & \nCo., Inc.) administered concomitantly at separate sites. Safety was evaluated in 2,733 subjects \nwho received Quadracel and 621 subjects who received DAPTACEL + IPOL vaccines. \nAmong these subjects, 51.5% were male, 48.5% were female, 75.7% were Caucasian, 8.6% were \nBlack, 7.9% were Hispanic, 0.9% were Asian, and 7.8% were of other racial/ethnic groups. The \nmean age for both groups was 4.4 years and the ratio of male to female subjects and ethnicity \nwere balanced between both groups. \nSolicited injection site reactions and systemic reactions were collected daily for 7 days following \nvaccination, via diary cards. Participants were monitored for unsolicited adverse events for 28 \ndays and serious adverse events (SAEs) for 6 months after vaccination.  \nSolicited Adverse Reactions \nThe incidence and severity of solicited injection site and systemic adverse reactions that occurred \nwithin 7 days after vaccination in each study group are shown in Table 1. \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n521 – Quadracel® \n \n5 \nTable 1: Percentage of Children 4 through 6 years of Age with Solicited Adverse Reactions \nby Intensity Within 7 Days of Vaccination with Quadracel or Concomitant but Separate \nDAPTACEL and IPOL vaccines Co-Administered with MMR and Varicella Vaccines*  \n \nQuadracel \n(N†= 2,500-2,689) \nDAPTACEL + IPOL \n(N† = 598-603) \nInjection Site Reactions \nQuadracel site \nDAPTACEL or IPOL site \nPain,Any  \n77.4 \n76.5 \nPain‡, Grade 1 \n56.4 \n54.9 \nPain‡, Grade 2 \n19.0 \n18.6 \nPain‡, Grade 3 \n2.0 \n3.0 \nChange in limb circumference§, \nAny  \n68.1 \n65.1 \nChange in limb circumference§, \nGrade 1 \n59.8 \n58.6 \nChange in limb circumference§, \nGrade 2 \n8.2 \n6.5 \nChange in limb circumference§, \nGrade 3 \n0.2 \n0.0 \nErythema, Any \n59.1 \n53.4 \nErythema, >0 to <25 mm \n31.6 \n31.8 \nErythema, ≥25 to <50 mm \n9.5 \n9.6 \nErythema, ≥50 mm \n18.0 \n11.9 \nSwelling, Any \n40.2 \n36.4 \nSwelling, >0 to <25 mm \n23.5 \n23.1 \nSwelling, ≥25 to <50 mm \n8.1 \n6.1 \nSwelling, ≥50 mm \n8.6 \n7.1 \nExtensive limb swelling, Any \n1.5 \n1.3 \nSystemic Reactions \n \n \nMyalgia#, Any  \n53.8 \n52.6 \nMyalgia#, Grade 1 \n36.0 \n33.5 \nMyalgia#, Grade 2 \n15.8 \n16.3 \nMyalgia#, Grade 3 \n1.9 \n2.8 \nMalaise#, Any  \n35.0 \n33.2 \nMalaise#, Grade 1 \n21.7 \n18.7 \nMalaise#, Grade 2 \n10.6 \n11.1 \nMalaise#, Grade 3 \n2.6 \n3.3 \nHeadache#, Any  \n15.6 \n16.6 \nHeadache#, Grade 1 \n11.9 \n11.9 \nHeadache#, Grade 2 \n3.1 \n4.0 \nHeadache#, Grade 3 \n0.6 \n0.7 \nFever, Any  \n6.0 \n6.9 \nFever ≥38.0°C to ≤38.4°C \n2.6 \n3.0 \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n521 – Quadracel® \n \n6 \n \nQuadracel \n(N†= 2,500-2,689) \nDAPTACEL + IPOL \n(N† = 598-603) \nFever, ≥38.5°C to ≤38.9°C \n2.1 \n1.8 \nFever, ≥39.0°C \n1.3 \n2.0 \n*  ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01346293. \n†  N = The number of subjects with available data. \n‡  Grade 1: Easily tolerated, Grade 2: Sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal behavior or activities, \nGrade 3: Incapacitating, unable to perform usual activities. \n§  Grade 1: >0 to <25 mm increase over pre-vaccination measurement, Grade 2: ≥25 to ≤50 mm increase over pre-\nvaccination measurement, Grade 3: >50 mm increase over pre-vaccination measurement.  \n¶  Swelling of the injected limb including the adjacent joint (i.e., elbow and/or shoulder) as compared to baseline. \n#  Grade 1: No interference with activity, Grade 2: Some interference with activity, Grade 3: Significant; prevents \ndaily activity. \nSerious Adverse Events \nIn Study M5I02, within 28 days following vaccination with Quadracel, or DAPTACEL + IPOL \nvaccines, and concomitant MMR and varicella vaccines, 0.1% of subjects (3/2,733) in the \nQuadracel group experienced a serious adverse event. During the same time period, 0.2% \nsubjects (1/621) in the DAPTACEL + IPOL group experienced a SAE. Within the 6-month \nfollow-up period after vaccination, SAEs were reported in 0.8% of subjects (21/2,733) who \nreceived Quadracel and 0.5% of subjects (3/621) who received DAPTACEL + IPOL vaccines, \nnone of which were assessed as related to vaccination.  \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience  \nThe following adverse events have been spontaneously reported, during the post-marketing use \nof Quadracel outside the US, in infants and children from 2 months through 6 years of age. \nBecause these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not \npossible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to vaccine \nexposure. This list includes adverse events based on one or more of the following factors: \nseverity, frequency of reporting, or strength of evidence for a causal relationship to Quadracel. \n• Immune system disorders  \nAnaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity and allergic reactions (such as rash, urticaria, \ndyspnea) \n• Psychiatric disorders \nScreaming \n• Nervous system disorders \nSomnolence, convulsion, febrile convulsion, HHE, hypotonia \n• Cardiac disorders \nCyanosis  \n• Vascular disorders \nPallor \n• General disorders and administration site conditions  \nListlessness \nInjection site reactions (including inflammation, mass, sterile abscess, and edema) \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n521 – Quadracel® \n \n7 \nLarge injection site reactions (>50 mm), including limb swelling which may extend from \nthe injection site beyond one or both joints \n• Infections and Infestations \nInjection site cellulitis, injection site abscess \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 \nConcomitant Administration with Other Vaccines  \nIn the US clinical trial, Study M5I02, Quadracel was administered concomitantly with one or \nmore of the following US-licensed vaccines: MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine [see Adverse \nReactions (6.1)]. \nWhen Quadracel is given at the same time as another injectable vaccine(s), the vaccines should \nbe administered with different syringes and at different injection sites. \n7.2 \nImmunosuppressive Treatments  \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic \ndrugs and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune \nresponse to Quadracel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].  \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nThe safety and effectiveness of Quadracel has not been established in children less than 4 years \nof age or children 7 through 16 years of age and is not approved for use in these age groups. \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nQuadracel (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed and Inactivated \nPoliovirus Vaccine) is a sterile suspension for intramuscular injection.  \nEach 0.5 mL dose is formulated to contain 15 Lf diphtheria toxoid, 5 Lf tetanus toxoid, acellular \npertussis antigens [20 mcg detoxified pertussis toxin (PT), 20 mcg filamentous hemagglutinin \n(FHA), 3 mcg pertactin (PRN), 5 mcg fimbriae types 2 and 3 (FIM)], and inactivated \npolioviruses [29 D-antigen units (DU) Type 1 (Mahoney), 7 DU Type 2 (MEF-1), 26 DU Type 3 \n(Saukett)]. \nCorynebacterium diphtheriae is grown in modified Mueller’s growth medium. (1) After \npurification by ammonium sulfate fractionation, the diphtheria toxin is detoxified with \nformaldehyde and diafiltered.  \nClostridium tetani is grown in modified Mueller-Miller casamino acid medium without beef \nheart infusion. (2) Tetanus toxin is detoxified with formaldehyde and purified by ammonium \nsulfate fractionation and diafiltration. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are individually adsorbed \nonto aluminum phosphate. \nThe acellular pertussis vaccine antigens are produced from Bordetella pertussis cultures grown \nin Stainer-Scholte medium (3) modified by the addition of casamino acids and dimethyl-beta-\ncyclodextrin. PT, FHA and PRN are isolated separately from the supernatant culture medium. \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n521 – Quadracel® \n \n8 \nFIM are extracted and copurified from the bacterial cells. The pertussis antigens are purified by \nsequential filtration, salt-precipitation, ultrafiltration and chromatography. PT is detoxified with \nglutaraldehyde. FHA is treated with formaldehyde and the residual aldehydes are removed by \nultrafiltration. The individual antigens are adsorbed separately onto aluminum phosphate. \nThe Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 polioviruses are individually grown in Vero cells (a continuous \nline of monkey kidney cells). Prior to viral propagation, the cells are grown in Iscove’s medium, \nsupplemented with calf serum. For viral propagation, the culture medium is replaced by M199 \nmedium without calf serum. The viral harvests are concentrated and purified, then inactivated \nwith formaldehyde to produce monovalent suspensions of each serotype. Specified quantities of \nmonovalent suspensions of each serotype are mixed to produce the trivalent poliovirus \nconcentrate. The adsorbed diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis antigens are combined with \naluminum phosphate, 2-phenoxyethanol (not as a preservative) and water for injection, into an \nintermediate concentrate. The trivalent poliovirus concentrate is added and the vaccine is diluted \nto its final concentration.  \nEach 0.5 mL dose contains 1.5 mg aluminum phosphate (0.33 mg aluminum) as the adjuvant, \n<8.1 mcg polysorbate 80, 3.3 mg (0.6% v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol (not as a preservative), 2 mcg to \n7 mcg residual formaldehyde, <50 ng residual glutaraldehyde, ≤10 ng residual bovine serum \nalbumin, <0.0001 pg streptomycin sulphate, <0.01 pg of neomycin and <0.000001 pg polymyxin \nB sulphate.  \nQuadracel does not contain a preservative. \nBoth diphtheria and tetanus toxoids induce at least 2 neutralizing units per mL in the guinea pig \npotency test. The potency of the acellular pertussis antigens is evaluated by the antibody \nresponse of immunized mice to detoxified PT, FHA, PRN and FIM as measured by enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The potency of the inactivated poliovirus antigens is \ndetermined by measuring antibody-mediated neutralization of poliovirus in sera from immunized \nrats. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 Mechanism of Action  \nDiphtheria  \nDiphtheria is an acute toxin-mediated disease caused by toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae. \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to diphtheria \ntoxin. A serum diphtheria antitoxin level of 0.01 IU/mL is the lowest level giving some degree of \nprotection. Antitoxin levels of at least 0.1 IU/mL are generally regarded as protective. (4) Levels \nof 1.0 IU/mL have been associated with long-term protection. (5) \nTetanus \nTetanus is an acute disease caused by an extremely potent neurotoxin produced by C. tetani. \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to tetanus \ntoxin.  A serum tetanus antitoxin level of at least 0.01 IU/mL, measured by neutralization assay, \nis considered the minimum protective level. (4) (6). A tetanus antitoxoid level ≥0.1 IU/mL as \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n521 – Quadracel® \n \n9 \nmeasured by the ELISA used in clinical studies of Quadracel is considered protective.  \nPertussis \nPertussis (whooping cough) is a respiratory disease caused by B. pertussis. This Gram-negative \ncoccobacillus produces a variety of biologically active components, though their role in either \nthe pathogenesis of, or immunity to, pertussis has not been clearly defined.  \nThere is no well-established serological correlate of protection for pertussis. Because \nDAPTACEL contains the same pertussis antigens manufactured by the same process as those in \nQuadracel, the effectiveness of Quadracel against pertussis was based on a comparison of \npertussis immune responses following Quadracel to those following DAPTACEL (Diphtheria \nand Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The \nefficacy of the pertussis component of DAPTACEL was determined in clinical trials of \nDAPTACEL administered to infants (see DAPTACEL prescribing information). Quadracel \ncontains twice as much detoxified PT and four times as much FHA as DAPTACEL. Quadracel \ncontains the same quantity of the same pertussis antigens manufactured by the same process as \nthose in Pentacel and VAXELIS.  \nPoliomyelitis \nPolioviruses, of which there are three serotypes (Types 1, 2, and 3), are enteroviruses. The \npresence of poliovirus type-specific neutralizing antibodies has been correlated with protection \nagainst poliomyelitis. (7) \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nQuadracel has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of \nfertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \nThe poliovirus component (poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3) of this formulation of Quadracel is grown \nin Vero cells [see Description (11)]. The clinical study data in this section were accrued with a \nQuadracel formulation in which the poliovirus component was grown in MRC-5 cells. The \npoliovirus component of the two formulations of Quadracel are analytically comparable.  \n14.1 Immunogenicity  \nIn Study M5I02, children 4 through 6 years of age received Quadracel or DAPTACEL + IPOL \nas the fifth dose in the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccination series and the fourth or fifth \ndose in the inactivated poliovirus vaccination series. Subjects also received their second dose of \nMMR and Varicella vaccines, concomitantly. The immunogenicity subset comprised 263 \nsubjects in the Quadracel group and 253 subjects in the DAPTACEL + IPOL vaccines group [see \nClinical Trials Experience (6.1)].  \nAntibody levels to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (PT, FHA, PRN and FIM) and poliovirus \nantigens were measured in sera obtained immediately prior to vaccination and 28 days after \nvaccination. The co-primary endpoints were booster response rates and antibody geometric mean \nconcentrations/titers (GMCs/GMTs) to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliovirus antigens \nSanofi Pasteur \nFull Prescribing Information \n521 – Quadracel® \n \n10 \nelicited after vaccination.

Do not use if resuspension \ndoes not occur with vigorous shaking. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for \nparticulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container \npermit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered. \nAttach a sterile needle and administer intramuscularly. \nDo not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously. \n2.2 \nDose and Schedule  \nA 0.5-mL dose of INFANRIX is approved for intramuscular administration in infants and \nchildren aged 6 weeks through 6 years (prior to the seventh birthday) as a 5-dose series. The \nseries consists of a primary immunization course of 3 doses administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of \nage (at intervals of 4 to 8 weeks), followed by 2 booster doses, administered at 15 to 20 months \nof age and at 4 to 6 years of age. The first dose may be given as early as 6 weeks of age. \nThe preferred administration site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh for most infants aged \nyounger than 12 months and the deltoid muscle of the upper arm for most children aged \n12 months through 6 years. \n2.3 \nUse of INFANRIX with Other DTaP Vaccines  \nSufficient data are not available on the safety and effectiveness of interchanging INFANRIX and \nDiphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis (DTaP) vaccines from different \nmanufacturers for successive doses of the DTaP vaccination series. Because the pertussis antigen \ncomponents of INFANRIX and PEDIARIX [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular \nPertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis B (Recombinant) and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine] are the \nsame, INFANRIX may be used to complete a DTaP vaccination series initiated with PEDIARIX. \n2.4 \nAdditional Dosing Information  \nIf any recommended dose of pertussis vaccine cannot be given [see Contraindications (4.2, 4.3), \nWarnings and Precautions (5.3)], Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids Adsorbed (DT) For Pediatric \nUse should be given according to its prescribing information. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nINFANRIX is a suspension for injection available in 0.5-mL single-dose, prefilled TIP-LOK \nsyringes. \n \n3\n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity  \nSevere allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any diphtheria toxoid-, \ntetanus toxoid-, or pertussis-containing vaccine, or to any component of INFANRIX is a \ncontraindication [see Description (11)]. Because of the uncertainty as to which component of the \nvaccine might be responsible, no further vaccination with any of these components should be \ngiven. Alternatively, such individuals may be referred to an allergist for evaluation if \nimmunization with any of these components is being considered. \n4.2 \nEncephalopathy  \nEncephalopathy (e.g., coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) within 7 days \nof administration of a previous dose of a pertussis-containing vaccine that is not attributable to \nanother identifiable cause is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing \nvaccine, including INFANRIX. \n4.3 \nProgressive Neurologic Disorder  \nProgressive neurologic disorder, including infantile spasms, uncontrolled epilepsy, or \nprogressive encephalopathy, is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing \nvaccine, including INFANRIX. Pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with \nthese conditions until a treatment regimen has been established and the condition has stabilized. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nGuillain-Barré Syndrome  \nIf Guillain-Barré syndrome occurs within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus \ntoxoid, the decision to give any tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, including INFANRIX, should \nbe based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks. When a decision is \nmade to withhold tetanus toxoid, other available vaccines should be given, as indicated. \n5.2 \nSyncope  \nSyncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including \nINFANRIX. Syncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual \ndisturbance, paresthesia, and tonic-clonic limb movements. Procedures should be in place to \navoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope. \n5.3 \nAdverse Reactions following Prior Pertussis Vaccination  \nIf any of the following reactions occur in temporal relation to receipt of a pertussis-containing \nvaccine, the decision to give any pertussis-containing vaccine, including INFANRIX, should be \nbased on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks: \n• Temperature of 40.5oC (105oF) within 48 hours not due to another identifiable cause; \n• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours; \n \n4\n• Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours; \n• Seizures with or without fever occurring within 3 days. \n5.4 \nChildren at Risk for Seizures  \nFor children at higher risk for seizures than the general population, an appropriate antipyretic \nmay be administered at the time of vaccination with a pertussis-containing vaccine, including \nINFANRIX, and for the ensuing 24 hours to reduce the possibility of post-vaccination fever. \n5.5 \nApnea in Premature Infants  \nApnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. \nDecisions about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including INFANRIX, to infants \nborn prematurely should be based on consideration of the individual infant’s medical status and \nthe potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. \n5.6 \nPreventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions  \nPrior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the patient’s immunization history \nfor possible vaccine hypersensitivity. Epinephrine and other appropriate agents used for the \ncontrol of immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available should an acute \nanaphylactic reaction occur. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nApproximately 95,000 doses of INFANRIX have been administered in clinical studies. In these \nstudies, 29,243 infants have received INFANRIX in primary series studies: 6,081 children have \nreceived a fourth consecutive dose of INFANRIX, 1,764 children have received a fifth \nconsecutive dose of INFANRIX, and 559 children have received a dose of INFANRIX following \n3 doses of PEDIARIX. \nSolicited Adverse Reactions \nIn a U.S. study, 335 infants received INFANRIX, ENGERIX-B [Hepatitis B Vaccine \n(Recombinant)], inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV, Sanofi Pasteur SA), Haemophilus b (Hib) \nconjugate vaccine (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.; no longer licensed in the United States), and \npneumococcal 7-valent conjugate (PCV7) vaccine (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.) concomitantly \nat separate sites. All vaccines were administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Data on solicited \nlocal reactions and general adverse reactions were collected by parents using standardized diary \ncards for 4 consecutive days following each vaccine dose (i.e., day of vaccination and the next \n3 days) (Table 1).

Cards from the whole cohort were returned at subsequent visits and were \nsupplemented by spontaneous reporting by parents and a medical history after the first and \n \n11\nsecond doses of vaccine. In the subset of 2,457, adverse events following the third dose of \nvaccine were reported via standardized diaries and spontaneous reporting at a follow-up visit. \nAdverse events in the remainder of the cohort were reported via report cards which were \nreturned by mail approximately 28 days after the third dose of vaccine. Adverse reactions (rates \nper 1,000 doses) occurring within 7 days following any of the first 3 doses included: unusual \ncrying (0.09), febrile seizure (0.0), afebrile seizure (0.13), and hypotonic-hyporesponsive \nepisodes (0.01). \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience  \nIn addition to reports in clinical trials for INFANRIX, the following adverse reactions have been \nidentified during postapproval use of INFANRIX. Because these reactions are reported \nvoluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their \nfrequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccination. \nInfections and Infestations \nBronchitis, cellulitis, respiratory tract infection. \nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders \nLymphadenopathy, thrombocytopenia. \nImmune System Disorders \nAnaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity. \nNervous System Disorders \nEncephalopathy, headache, hypotonia, syncope. \nEar and Labyrinth Disorders \nEar pain. \nCardiac Disorders \nCyanosis. \nRespiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \nApnea, cough. \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \nAngioedema, erythema, pruritus, rash, urticaria. \nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \nFatigue, injection site induration, injection site reaction, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. \n \n12\n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 \nConcomitant Vaccine Administration  \nIn clinical trials, INFANRIX was given concomitantly with Hib conjugate vaccine, \npneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, IPV, and the second dose of \nMMR vaccine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.3)]. \nWhen INFANRIX is administered concomitantly with other injectable vaccines, they should be \ngiven with separate syringes. INFANRIX should not be mixed with any other vaccine in the \nsame syringe. \n7.2 \nImmunosuppressive Therapies  \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic \ndrugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune \nresponse to INFANRIX. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nSafety and effectiveness of INFANRIX in infants aged younger than 6 weeks and children aged \n7 to 16 years have not been established. INFANRIX is not approved for use in these age groups. \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nINFANRIX (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed) is a \nnoninfectious, sterile vaccine for intramuscular administration. Each 0.5-mL dose is formulated \nto contain 25 Lf of diphtheria toxoid, 10 Lf of tetanus toxoid, 25 mcg of inactivated pertussis \ntoxin (PT), 25 mcg of filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and 8 mcg of pertactin (69 kiloDalton \nouter membrane protein). \nThe diphtheria toxin is produced by growing Corynebacterium diphtheriae (C. diphtheriae) in \nFenton medium containing a bovine extract. Tetanus toxin is produced by growing Clostridium \ntetani (C. tetani) in a modified Latham medium derived from bovine casein. The bovine \nmaterials used in these extracts are sourced from countries which the United States Department \nof Agriculture (USDA) has determined neither have nor present an undue risk for bovine \nspongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Both toxins are detoxified with formaldehyde, concentrated \nby ultrafiltration, and purified by precipitation, dialysis, and sterile filtration. \nThe acellular pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, and pertactin) are isolated from Bordetella pertussis \n(B. pertussis) culture grown in modified Stainer-Scholte liquid medium. PT and FHA are \nisolated from the fermentation broth; pertactin is extracted from the cells by heat treatment and \nflocculation. The antigens are purified in successive chromatographic and precipitation steps. PT \nis detoxified using glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde. FHA and pertactin are treated with \nformaldehyde. \n \n13\nDiphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, and pertactin) are individually \nadsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide. \nDiphtheria and tetanus toxoid potency is determined by measuring the amount of neutralizing \nantitoxin in previously immunized guinea pigs. The potency of the acellular pertussis \ncomponents (PT, FHA, and pertactin) is determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \n(ELISA) on sera from previously immunized mice. \nEach 0.5-mL dose contains aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant (formulated to contain 0.5 mg \naluminum) and 4.4 mg of sodium chloride. The aluminum content is measured by assay. Each \ndose also contains 100 mcg of residual formaldehyde and 100 mcg of polysorbate 80 (Tween \n80). \nThe tip cap and rubber plunger stopper of the prefilled syringe are not made with natural rubber \nlatex. \nINFANRIX is formulated without preservatives. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action  \nDiphtheria \nDiphtheria is an acute toxin-mediated infectious disease caused by toxigenic strains of \nC. diphtheriae. Protection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to \nthe diphtheria toxin. A serum diphtheria antitoxin level of 0.01 IU/mL is the lowest level giving \nsome degree of protection; a level of 0.1 IU/mL is regarded as protective.1 \nTetanus \nTetanus is an acute toxin-mediated infectious disease caused by a potent exotoxin released by \nC. tetani. Protection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to the \ntetanus toxin. A serum tetanus antitoxin level of at least 0.01 IU/mL, measured by neutralization \nassays, is considered the minimum protective level.2,3 A level of 0.1 IU/mL is considered \nprotective.4 \nPertussis \nPertussis (whooping cough) is a disease of the respiratory tract caused by B. pertussis. The role \nof the different components produced by B. pertussis in either the pathogenesis of, or the \nimmunity to, pertussis is not well understood. There is no well-established serological correlate \nof protection for pertussis. \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nINFANRIX has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or for impairment of \n \n14\nfertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \n14.1 \nDiphtheria and Tetanus  \nEfficacy of diphtheria toxoid used in INFANRIX was determined on the basis of \nimmunogenicity studies. A VERO cell toxin-neutralizing test confirmed the ability of infant sera \n(N = 45), obtained one month after a 3-dose primary series, to neutralize diphtheria toxin. Levels \nof diphtheria antitoxin 0.01 IU/mL were achieved in 100% of the sera tested. \nEfficacy of tetanus toxoid used in INFANRIX was determined on the basis of immunogenicity \nstudies. An in vivo mouse neutralization assay confirmed the ability of infant sera (N = 45), \nobtained1 month after a 3-dose primary series, to neutralize tetanus toxin. Levels of tetanus \nantitoxin 0.01 IU/mL were achieved in 100% of the sera tested. \n14.2 \nPertussis  \nEfficacy of a 3-dose primary series of INFANRIX has been assessed in 2 clinical studies. \nA double-blind, randomized, active Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids (DT)-controlled trial \nconducted in Italy assessed the absolute protective efficacy of INFANRIX when administered at \n2, 4, and 6 months of age. The population used in the primary analysis of the efficacy of \nINFANRIX included 4,481 infants vaccinated with INFANRIX and 1,470 DT vaccinees. The \nmean length of follow-up was 17 months, beginning 30 days after the third dose of vaccine. \nAfter 3 doses, the absolute protective efficacy of INFANRIX against WHO-defined typical \npertussis (21 days or more of paroxysmal cough with infection confirmed by culture and/or \nserologic testing) was 84% (95% CI: 76, 89). When the definition of pertussis was expanded to \ninclude clinically milder disease with respect to type and duration of cough, with infection \nconfirmed by culture and/or serologic testing, the efficacy of INFANRIX was calculated to be \n71% (95% CI: 60, 78) against >7 days of any cough and 73% (95% CI: 63, 80) against 14 days \nof any cough. Vaccine efficacy after 3 doses and with no booster dose in the second year of life \nwas assessed in 2 subsequent follow-up periods. A follow-up period from 24 months to a mean \nage of 33 months was conducted in a partially unblinded cohort (children who received DT were \noffered pertussis vaccine and those who declined were retained in the study cohort). During this \nperiod, the efficacy of INFANRIX against WHO-defined pertussis was 78% (95% CI: 62, 87). \nDuring the third follow-up period, which was conducted in an unblinded manner among children \naged 3 to 6 years, the efficacy of INFANRIX against WHO-defined pertussis was 86% (95% CI: \n79, 91). Thus, protection against pertussis in children administered 3 doses of INFANRIX in \ninfancy was sustained to 6 years of age. \nA prospective efficacy trial was also conducted in Germany employing a household contact \nstudy design. In preparation for this study, 3 doses of INFANRIX were administered at 3, 4, and \n5 months of age to more than 22,000 children living in 6 areas of Germany in a safety and \nimmunogenicity study. Infants who did not participate in the safety and immunogenicity study \n \n15\ncould have received a DTwP vaccine or DT vaccine. Index cases were identified by spontaneous \npresentation to a physician. Households with at least one other member (i.e., besides index case) \naged 6 through 47 months were enrolled. Household contacts of index cases were monitored for \nincidence of pertussis by a physician who was blinded to the vaccination status of the household. \nCalculation of vaccine efficacy was based on attack rates of pertussis in household contacts \nclassified by vaccination status. Of the 173 household contacts who had not received a pertussis \nvaccine, 96 developed WHO-defined pertussis, as compared with 7 of 112 contacts vaccinated \nwith INFANRIX. The protective efficacy of INFANRIX was calculated to be 89% (95% CI: 77, \n95), with no indication of waning of protection up until the time of the booster vaccination. The \naverage age of infants vaccinated with INFANRIX at the end of follow-up in this trial was \n13 months (range: 6 to 25 months). When the definition of pertussis was expanded to include \nclinically milder disease, with infection confirmed by culture and/or serologic testing, the \nefficacy of INFANRIX against 7 days of any cough was 67% (95% CI: 52, 78) and against \n7 days of paroxysmal cough was 81% (95% CI: 68, 89). The corresponding efficacy of \nINFANRIX against 14 days of any cough or paroxysmal cough were 73% (95% CI: 59, 82) and \n84% (95% CI: 71, 91), respectively. \nPertussis Immune Response to INFANRIX Administered as a 3-Dose Primary Series \nThe immune responses to each of the 3 pertussis antigens contained in INFANRIX were \nevaluated in sera obtained 1 month after the third dose of vaccine in each of 3 studies (schedule \nof administration: 2, 4, and 6 months of age in the Italian efficacy study and one U.S. study; 3, 4, \nand 5 months of age in the German efficacy study). One month after the third dose of \nINFANRIX, the response rates to each pertussis antigen were similar in all 3 studies. Thus, \nalthough a serologic correlate of protection for pertussis has not been established, the antibody \nresponses to these 3 pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, and pertactin) in a U.S. population were \nsimilar to those achieved in 2 populations in which efficacy of INFANRIX was demonstrated. \n14.3 \nImmune Response to Concomitantly Administered Vaccines  \nIn a U.S. study, INFANRIX was given concomitantly, at separate sites, with Hib conjugate \nvaccine (Sanofi Pasteur SA) at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Subjects also received ENGERIX-B \nand oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). One month after the third dose of Hib conjugate vaccine, \n90% of 72 infants had anti-PRP (polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate) 1.0 mcg/mL. \nIn a U.S. study, INFANRIX was given concomitantly, at separate sites, with ENGERIX-B, IPV \n(Sanofi Pasteur SA), pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate (PCV7), and Hib conjugate vaccines \n(Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.; no longer licensed in the United States) at 2, 4, and 6 months of \nage. Immune responses were measured in sera obtained approximately 1 month after the third \ndose of vaccines. Among 121 subjects who had not received a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine, \n99.2% had anti-HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) 10 mIU/mL following the third dose of \nENGERIX-B. Among 153 subjects, 100% had anti-poliovirus 1, 2, and 3, 1:8 following the \nthird dose of IPV. Although serological correlates for protection have not been established for \n \n16\nthe pneumococcal serotypes, a threshold level of 0.3 mcg/mL was evaluated. Following the \nthird dose of PCV7 vaccine, 91.8% to 99.4% of subjects (n = 146-156) had anti-pneumococcal \npolysaccharide 0.3 mcg/mL for serotypes 4, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F, and 73.0% had a level \n0.3 mcg/mL for serotype 6B. \n15 \nREFERENCES  \n1.

Use immediately. If COMIRNATY cannot be used immediately, it must be used within 4 hours. \n \nCOMIRNATY Single Dose Vials \n \n• Verify that the vial states 2024-2025 Formula. \n• If vial is frozen, thaw vial in the refrigerator [2ºC to 8ºC (35ºF to 46ºF) for up to 2 hours] or at room \ntemperature [up to 25ºC (77ºF) for 30 minutes] [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. \n• Prior to use, mix by inverting vial gently 10 times. Do not shake. \n• Withdraw a single 0.3 mL dose using a sterile needle and syringe. \n• Discard vial and any excess volume. \n \n2.2 \nAdministration Information \n \nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to \nadministration, whenever solution and container permit. The vaccine will be a white to off-white suspension. \nDo not administer if vaccine is discolored or contains particulate matter. \n \nAdminister the 0.3 mL dose intramuscularly immediately after preparation. For the prefilled syringe, administer \nthe entire volume to deliver a single 0.3 mL dose.  \n \n2.3 \nVaccination Schedule \n \nCOMIRNATY is administered as a single dose for individuals 12 years of age and older. \n \nFor individuals previously vaccinated with any COVID-19 vaccine, administer the dose of COMIRNATY at least \n2 months after the last dose of COVID-19 vaccine. \n \n \n3 \n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \n \nCOMIRNATY is a suspension for injection. A single dose is 0.3 mL. \n \n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS \n \nDo not administer COMIRNATY to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., \nanaphylaxis) to any component of COMIRNATY [see Description (11)] or to individuals who had a severe \nallergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) following a previous dose of a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. \n \n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n \n5.1 \nManagement of Acute Allergic Reactions \n \nAppropriate medical treatment must be immediately available to manage potential anaphylactic reactions \nfollowing administration of COMIRNATY.  \n \n5.2 \nMyocarditis and Pericarditis \n \nPostmarketing data with authorized or approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines demonstrate increased risks of \nmyocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within the first week following vaccination. For COMIRNATY, the \nobserved risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Although some cases required intensive care \nsupport, available data from short-term follow-up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of \nsymptoms with conservative management. Information is not yet available about potential long-term sequelae.  \n \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published considerations related to myocarditis and \npericarditis after vaccination, including for vaccination of individuals with a history of myocarditis or \npericarditis (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html). \n \n5.3 \nSyncope \n \nSyncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including \nCOMIRNATY. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. \n \n5.4 \nAltered Immunocompetence \n \nImmunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a \ndiminished immune response to COMIRNATY [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. \n \n5.5 \nLimitation of Effectiveness \n \nCOMIRNATY may not protect all vaccine recipients. \n \n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \n \nAn overview of clinical studies contributing to the safety assessment of COMIRNATY is provided in Table 1. \nParticipants in these clinical studies received a 2-dose series, 3 weeks apart (referred to as a primary series) and \nsubsequent doses referred to as booster doses. \n \n \n4 \nTable 1:  Clinical Studies  \nStudy \nAge Group \nVaccine Strain \nComposition  \nDosing \nNumber of \nParticipants \nPrimary Series \nStudy 1 \n(NCT04380701) \n18 through 55 years \nOriginala \nPrimary series \n60 \nStudy 2 \n(NCT04368728)  \n12 through 15 years of age \nOriginala \nPrimary series \n1131b \n≥16 years of age \nOriginala \nPrimary series \n22026b \nBooster Dose \nStudy 2 \n(NCT04368728)  \n12 through 15 years of age \nOriginala \n1st booster \n825 \n18 through 55 years of age \nOriginala \n1st booster \n306 \nStudy 4 \n(NCT04955626)  \n12 through 17 years of age \nOriginala \n1st booster \n65 \n≥16 years of age \nOriginala \n1st booster \n5081b \nStudy 5 \n(NCT05472038)  \n≥12 years of age \nOriginal and Omicron \nBA.4/BA.5c \n2nd booster \n726 \nConcomitant Administration \nStudy 8 \n(NCT05310084) 18 through 64 years of age \nOriginala \n2nd booster \nadministered alone \nor concomitantly \nwith Influenza \nVaccined \n1128 \nAbbreviation: SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. \na.

Influenza Vaccine (Afluria Quadrivalent). \n \nPrimary Series with COMIRNATY \n \nParticipants 12 through 15 years of age in Study 2: the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥8%) \nfollowing any dose were pain at the injection site (90.5%), fatigue (77.5%), headache (75.5%), chills (49.2%), \nmuscle pain (42.2%), fever (24.3%), joint pain (20.2%), injection site swelling (9.2%), and injection site \nredness (8.6%). \n \nParticipants 16 through 55 years of age in Study 2: the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥10%) \nfollowing any dose were pain at the injection site (88.6%), fatigue (70.1%), headache (64.9%), muscle pain \n(45.5%), chills (41.5%), joint pain (27.5%), fever (17.8%), and injection site swelling (10.6%). \n \nParticipants 56 years of age and older in Study 2: the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥10%) \nfollowing any dose were pain at the injection site (78.2%), fatigue (56.9%), headache, (45.9%), muscle pain \n(32.5%), chills (24.8%), joint pain (21.5%), injection site swelling (11.8%), fever (11.5%), and injection site \nredness (10.4%). \n \nBooster Dose with COMIRNATY \n \nParticipants 12 years of age and older in Studies 2 and 4: the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥5%) \nfollowing administration of a first booster dose with COMIRNATY were similar to those reported by \nparticipants who received COMIRNATY in the primary series. \n \n \n5 \nBooster Dose With Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent \n \nParticipants 12 years of age and older in Study 5: the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥5%) \nfollowing administration of a second booster dose with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent were \npain at the injection site (67.3%), fatigue (52.6%), headache (40.5%), muscle pain (24.6%), chills (18.0%), joint \npain (13.3%), fever (5.3%), injection site swelling (5.3%), and injection site redness (5.3%). \n \n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience \n \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the \nclinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may \nnot reflect the rates observed in practice. \n \nPrimary Series With COMIRNATY \n \nThe safety of a 2-dose primary series of COMIRNATY was evaluated in participants 12 years of age and older \nin 2 clinical studies conducted in Germany (Study 1), United States, Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, South Africa, \nand Germany (Study 2). Study BNT162-01 (Study 1) was a Phase 1/2, 2-part, dose-escalation trial that enrolled \n60 participants, 18 through 55 years of age and 36 participants, 56 through 85 years of age. Study 2 was a Phase \n1/2/3 multicenter, randomized, saline placebo-controlled, double-blinded (Phase 2/3), dose finding-, vaccine \ncandidate-selection and efficacy study that enrolled approximately 46,000 participants 12 years of age or older. \nOf these, approximately 2,260 participants were 12 through 15 years of age (1,131 COMIRNATY; 1,129 \nplacebo) and 754 were 16 through 17 years of age (378 COMIRNATY; 376 placebo). In all, 44,047 participants \nin Phase 2/3 were 16 years of age or older (22,026 COMIRNATY; 22,021 placebo).  \n \nStudy 2 included 200 participants with confirmed stable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. \nConfirmed stable HIV infection was defined as documented viral load <50 copies/mL and CD4 count \n>200 cells/mm3 within 6 months before enrollment, and on stable antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months. \nHIV-positive participants are included in the safety population but are summarized separately in the safety \nanalyses. \n \nIn Study 2, participants 12 years and older in the reactogenicity subset were monitored using an electronic diary \nfor solicited local and systemic reactions and use of antipyretic medication after each vaccination. Participants \nwere also monitored for unsolicited adverse events throughout the study (from Dose 1 through 1 month [all \nunsolicited adverse events] or through 6 months [serious adverse events] after the last vaccination). Tables 2 \nand 3 present the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days \nfollowing any dose of COMIRNATY. \n \nAdolescents 12 Through 15 Years of Age  \n \nIn Study 2, 2,260 adolescents (1,131 COMIRNATY; 1,129 placebo) were 12 through 15 years of age. At the \ntime of the analysis of the ongoing Study 2 with a data cutoff of September 2, 2021, there were 1,559 (69.0%) \nadolescents (786 COMIRNATY and 773 placebo) 12 through 15 years of age followed for ≥4 months after the \nsecond dose.  \n \nDemographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity \namong adolescents who received COMIRNATY and those who received placebo. Overall, among the \nadolescents who received COMIRNATY, 50.1% were male and 49.9% were female, 85.8% were White, 4.6% \nwere Black or African American, 11.7% were Hispanic/Latino, 6.4% were Asian, and 0.4% were American \nIndian/Alaska Native. \n \n6 \n \nLocal and Systemic Adverse Reactions Solicited in Study 2 \n \nIn adolescents 12 through 15 years of age after receiving Dose 2, the mean duration of pain at the injection site \nwas 2.5 days (range 1 to 11 days), for redness 1.8 days (range 1 to 5 days), and for swelling 1.6 days (range 1 to \n5 days) in the COMIRNATY group. \n \nTable 2:  Study 2 – Frequency and Percentages of Adolescents With Solicited Local Reactions, by \nMaximum Severity, Within 7 Days After Each Dose – Adolescents 12 Through 15 Years of \nAge – Safety Population* \n \nCOMIRNATY† \nDose 1  \nNa=1127 \nnb (%) \nPlacebo \nDose 1 \nNa=1127 \nnb (%) \nCOMIRNATY† \nDose 2 \nNa=1097 \nnb (%) \nPlacebo \nDose 2 \nNa=1078 \nnb (%) \nRednessc  \n \n \n \n \nAny (>2 cm) \n65 (5.8) \n12 (1.1) \n55 (5.0) \n10 (0.9) \nMild \n44 (3.9) \n11 (1.0) \n29 (2.6) \n8 (0.7) \nModerate \n20 (1.8) \n1 (0.1) \n26 (2.4) \n2 (0.2) \nSevere \n1 (0.1) \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \nSwellingc \n \n \n \n \nAny (>2 cm) \n78 (6.9) \n11 (1.0) \n54 (4.9) \n6 (0.6) \nMild \n55 (4.9) \n9 (0.8) \n36 (3.3) \n4 (0.4) \nModerate \n23 (2.0) \n2 (0.2) \n18 (1.6) \n2 (0.2) \nSevere \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \nPain at the injection sited \nAny \n971 (86.2) \n263 (23.3) \n866 (78.9) \n193 (17.9) \nMild \n467 (41.4) \n227 (20.1) \n466 (42.5) \n164 (15.2) \nModerate \n493 (43.7) \n36 (3.2) \n393 (35.8) \n29 (2.7) \nSevere \n11 (1.0) \n0 (0.0) \n7 (0.6) \n0 (0.0) \nNote: Reactions were collected in the electronic diary (e-diary) from Day 1 to Day 7 after vaccination.  \n* Randomized participants in the safety analysis population who received at least 1 dose of the study intervention. \n† Vaccine encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (Original). \na.

Of these, \n634 (56.1%) participants in the COMIRNATY group and 629 (55.7%) participants in the placebo group had \nfollow-up time between ≥4 months to <6 months after Dose 2 in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up \nperiod with an additional 152 (13.4%) and 144 (12.8%) with ≥6 months of blinded follow-up time in the \nCOMIRNATY and placebo groups, respectively. \n \nA total of 1,113 (98.4%) participants 12 through 15 years of age originally randomized to COMIRNATY had \n≥6 months total (blinded and unblinded) follow-up after Dose 2. An analysis of all unsolicited adverse events in \nStudy 2 from Dose 1 up to the participant unblinding date was conducted. Among participants 12 through \n15 years of age who received at least 1 dose of study vaccine, unsolicited adverse events were reported by \n95 (8.4%) participants in the COMIRNATY group and 113 (10.0%) participants in the placebo group.  \n \nIn an analysis of all unsolicited adverse events reported during blinded follow-up from Dose 1 through 1 month \nafter Dose 2, in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age, those assessed as adverse reactions not already captured by \nsolicited local and systemic reactions were lymphadenopathy (9 vs. 2), and nausea (5 vs. 2). \n \nIn the analysis of blinded, placebo-controlled follow-up, there were no other notable patterns or numerical \nimbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of unsolicited adverse events (including other \nneurologic or neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to \nCOMIRNATY. In the analysis of unblinded follow-up, there were no notable patterns of specific categories of \nnon-serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to COMIRNATY. \n \nSerious Adverse Events \n \nIn Study 2, among participants 12 through 15 years of age who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or \nplacebo (COMIRNATY = 1,131; placebo = 1,129), serious adverse events from Dose 1 up to the participant \nunblinding date in ongoing follow-up were reported by 10 (0.9%) COMIRNATY recipients and 2 (0.2%) \nplacebo recipients. In these analyses, 69.0% of study participants had at least 4 months of follow-up after \nDose 2. In the analysis of blinded, placebo-controlled follow-up, there were no notable patterns between \ntreatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, \nand thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to COMIRNATY. In the analysis of unblinded \nfollow-up, there were no notable patterns of specific categories of serious adverse events that would suggest a \ncausal relationship to COMIRNATY. \n \nParticipants 16 Years of Age and Older \n \nAt the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cutoff of March 13, 2021, there were 25,651 (58.2%) \nparticipants (13,031 COMIRNATY; 12,620 placebo) 16 years of age and older followed for ≥4 months after the \nsecond dose. \n \nDemographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity \namong participants who received COMIRNATY and those who received placebo. Overall, among the total \n \n9 \nparticipants who received either COMIRNATY or placebo, 50.9% were male, 49.1% were female, 79.3% were \n16 through 64 years of age, 20.7% were 65 years of age and older, 82.0% were White, 9.6% were Black or \nAfrican American, 25.9% were Hispanic/Latino, 4.3% were Asian, and 1.0% were American Indian or Alaska \nNative.  \n \nLocal and Systemic Adverse Reactions Solicited in the Study 2 \nIn participants 16 through 55 years of age after receiving Dose 2, the mean duration of pain at the injection site \nwas 2.5 days (range 1 to 70 days), for redness 2.2 days (range 1 to 9 days), and for swelling 2.1 days (range 1 to \n8 days) for participants in the COMIRNATY group.  \n \nIn participants 56 years of age and older after receiving Dose 2, the mean duration of pain at the injection site \nwas 2.4 days (range 1 to 36 days), for redness 3.0 days (range 1 to 34 days), and for swelling 2.6 days (range 1 \nto 34 days) for participants in the COMIRNATY group.  \n \nTable 4:  Study 2 – Frequency and Percentages of Participants With Solicited Local Reactions, by \nMaximum Severity, Within 7 Days After Each Dose – Participants 16 Through 55 Years of \nAge – Reactogenicity Subset of the Safety Population* \n \nCOMIRNATY† \nDose 1  \nNa=2899 \nnb (%) \nPlacebo \nDose 1 \nNa=2908 \nnb (%) \nCOMIRNATY† \nDose 2 \nNa=2682 \nnb (%) \nPlacebo \nDose 2 \nNa=2684 \nnb (%) \nRednessc  \nAny (>2.0 cm) \n156 (5.4) \n28 (1.0) \n151 (5.6) \n18 (0.7) \nMild \n113 (3.9) \n19 (0.7) \n90 (3.4) \n12 (0.4) \nModerate \n36 (1.2) \n6 (0.2) \n50 (1.9) \n6 (0.2) \nSevere \n7 (0.2) \n3 (0.1) \n11 (0.4) \n0 \nSwellingc \nAny (>2.0 cm) \n184 (6.3) \n16 (0.6) \n183 (6.8) \n5 (0.2) \nMild \n124 (4.3) \n6 (0.2) \n110 (4.1) \n3 (0.1) \nModerate \n54 (1.9) \n8 (0.3) \n66 (2.5) \n2 (0.1) \nSevere \n6 (0.2) \n2 (0.1) \n7 (0.3) \n0 \nPain at the injection sited \nAny \n2426 (83.7) \n414 (14.2) \n2101 (78.3) \n312 (11.6) \nMild \n1464 (50.5) \n391 (13.4) \n1274 (47.5) \n284 (10.6) \nModerate \n923 (31.8) \n20 (0.7) \n788 (29.4) \n28 (1.0) \nSevere \n39 (1.3) \n3 (0.1) \n39 (1.5) \n0 \nNotes: Reactions were collected in the electronic diary (e-diary) from Day 1 to Day 7 after vaccination. \nNo Grade 4 solicited local reactions were reported in participants 16 through 55 years of age. \n* Randomized participants in the safety analysis population who received at least 1 dose of the study intervention.

Among participants 16 through \n55 years of age who received at least 1 dose of study vaccine, 12,995 of whom received COMIRNATY and \n13,026 of whom received placebo, unsolicited adverse events were reported by 4,396 (33.8%) participants in \nthe COMIRNATY group and 2,136 (16.4%) participants in the placebo group. In a similar analysis in \n \n14 \nparticipants 56 years of age and older that included 8,931 COMIRNATY recipients and 8,895 placebo \nrecipients, unsolicited adverse events were reported by 2,551 (28.6%) participants in the COMIRNATY group \nand 1,432 (16.1%) participants in the placebo group. Among participants with confirmed stable HIV infection \nthat included 100 COMIRNATY recipients and 100 placebo recipients, unsolicited adverse events were \nreported by 29 (29%) participants in the COMIRNATY group and 15 (15%) participants in the placebo group. \nThe higher frequency of reported unsolicited adverse events among COMIRNATY recipients compared to \nplacebo recipients was primarily attributed to events that are consistent with adverse reactions solicited among \nparticipants in the reactogenicity subset (Table 6 and Table 7). \n \nThroughout the placebo-controlled safety follow-up period, Bell’s palsy (facial paralysis) was reported by \n4 participants in the COMIRNATY group and 2 participants in the placebo group. Onset of facial paralysis was \nDay 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. In the placebo \ngroup the onset of facial paralysis was Day 32 and Day 102. Currently available information is insufficient to \ndetermine a causal relationship with the vaccine. In the analysis of blinded, placebo-controlled follow-up, there \nwere no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of \nnon-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that \nwould suggest a causal relationship to COMIRNATY. In the analysis of unblinded follow-up, there were no \nnotable patterns of specific categories of non-serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to \nCOMIRNATY. \n \nSerious Adverse Events \n \nParticipants 16 through 55 years of age in Study 2 who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or placebo \n(COMIRNATY = 12,995; placebo = 13,026), reported serious adverse events from Dose 1 up to the participant \nunblinding date in ongoing follow-up as follows: 103 (0.8%) COMIRNATY recipients and 117 (0.9%) placebo \nrecipients. In a similar analysis, in participants 56 years of age and older (8,931 COMIRNATY group and 8,895 \nplacebo group), serious adverse events were reported by 165 (1.8%) COMIRNATY recipients and 151 (1.7%) \nplacebo recipients who received at least 1 dose of COMIRNATY or placebo, respectively. In these analyses, \n58.2% of study participants had at least 4 months of follow-up after Dose 2. Among participants with confirmed \nstable HIV infection serious adverse events from Dose 1 up to the participant unblinding date in ongoing \nfollow-up were reported by 2 (2%) COMIRNATY recipients and 2 (2%) placebo recipients.  \n \nIn the analysis of blinded, placebo-controlled follow-up, there were no notable patterns between treatment \ngroups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and \nthrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to COMIRNATY. In the analysis of unblinded \nfollow-up, there were no notable patterns of specific categories of serious adverse events that would suggest a \ncausal relationship to COMIRNATY. \n \nFirst Booster Dose With COMIRNATY Following the Primary Series \n \n12 Through 15 Years of Age \n \nA subset of 825 Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants 12 through 15 years of age received a booster dose of \nCOMIRNATY 11.2 months (median time, range 6.3 to 20.1 months) after completing the primary series and \nhad a median follow-up time of 9.5 months up to a data cutoff date of November 3, 2022.

The most common adverse reactions reported in the concomitant administration group and after \nCOMIRNATY alone were injection site pain (COMIRNATY injection site) (86.2% and 84.4%, respectively), \nfatigue (64.0% and 50.8%, respectively), and headache (47.2% and 37.8%, respectively). \n \n6.2 Postmarketing Experience  \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of COMIRNATY, \nPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent. Because these \nreactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably \nestimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. \n \nCardiac Disorders: myocarditis, pericarditis \nGastrointestinal Disorders: diarrhea, vomiting \nImmune System Disorders: severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other hypersensitivity reactions \n(e.g., rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema) \nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: pain in extremity (arm) \nNervous System Disorders: syncope, dizziness \n \n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n \n8.1 Pregnancy \n \nRisk Summary  \n \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the \nestimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to \n4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on COMIRNATY administered to pregnant women are \ninsufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.  \n \nA developmental toxicity study has been performed in female rats administered the equivalent of a single \nhuman dose of COMIRNATY [encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu 1 strain \n(Original)] on 4 occasions, twice prior to mating and twice during gestation. These studies revealed no evidence \nof harm to the fetus due to the vaccine (see Animal Data). \n \nClinical Considerations  \n \nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk \n \nPregnant individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 compared with \nnon-pregnant individuals. \n \nData \n \nAnimal Data \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study, 0.06 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of \nnucleoside-modified messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (30 mcg) and other ingredients included in a single \nhuman dose of COMIRNATY [encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu 1 strain \n \n20 \n(Original)] was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on 4 occasions: 21 and 14 days prior to \nmating, and on gestation days 9 and 20. No vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, fetal \ndevelopment, or postnatal development were reported in the study.   \n \n8.2 Lactation  \n \nRisk Summary \n \nIt is not known whether COMIRNATY is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects of \nCOMIRNATY on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. The developmental and health benefits \nof breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for COMIRNATY and any \npotential adverse effects on the breastfed child from COMIRNATY or from the underlying maternal condition. \nFor preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. \n \n8.4 Pediatric Use \n \nSafety and effectiveness of COMIRNATY in individuals 12 through 17 years of age is based on safety and \neffectiveness data in this age group and in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of COMIRNATY in individuals younger than 12 years of age have not been \nestablished. Evidence from clinical studies in individuals 6 months through 4 years of age strongly suggests that \na single dose of COMIRNATY would be ineffective in individuals younger than 6 months of age. \n \n8.5 Geriatric Use \n \nOf the total number of COMIRNATY recipients in Study 2 as of March 13, 2021 (N = 22,026), \n20.7% (n = 4,552) were 65 years of age and older and 4.2% (n = 925) were 75 years of age and older [see \nClinical Studies (14.1)]. In Study 4, of 5081 recipients who received COMIRNATY as the first booster dose, \n23.1% (n = 1175) were 65 years of age and older and 5.2% (n = 265) were 75 years of age and older. In Study \n5, of 726 recipients who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent as the second booster dose, \n21.9% (n = 159) were 65 years of age and older and 4.8% (n = 35) were 75 years of age and older. No overall \ndifferences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these recipients and younger recipients. \n \n8.6  Immunocompromised Individuals \n \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published considerations related to COVID-19 vaccination \nfor individuals who are moderately to severely immunocompromised (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-\n19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html). \n \n11 DESCRIPTION  \n \nCOMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is a sterile suspension for injection for intramuscular use.  \n \nEach 0.3 mL dose of COMIRNATY (2024-2025 Formula) is formulated to contain 30 mcg of a \nnucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 \nOmicron variant lineage KP.2. \n \nEach 0.3 mL dose of COMIRNATY also includes the following ingredients: \nlipids (0.43 mg ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), \n0.05 mg 2-(polyethylene glycol 2000)-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, \n \n21 \n0.09 mg 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and 0.19 mg cholesterol), 0.06 mg tromethamine, \n0.4 mg tromethamine hydrochloride, and 31 mg sucrose.  \n \nCOMIRNATY does not contain preservatives.  \n \nThe vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex.  \n \nThe prefilled syringe tip cap and plunger stopper are not made with natural rubber latex.  \n \n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n \n12.1 Mechanism of Action \n \nThe nucleoside-modified mRNA in COMIRNATY is formulated in lipid particles, which enable delivery of the \nmRNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits an immune \nresponse to the S antigen, which protects against COVID-19. \n \n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \n \nCOMIRNATY has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or impairment of \nmale fertility. In a developmental toxicity study in rats with COMIRNATY [encoding the viral spike (S) \nglycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu 1 strain (Original)] there were no vaccine-related effects on female \nfertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. \n \n14 CLINICAL STUDIES \n \n14.1  Immunogenicity Data Supporting the Use of a Single Dose of COMIRNATY in Seropositive, \nVaccine-Naïve Individuals \n \nIn a post-hoc analysis in a subset of participants 18 through 85 years of age enrolled in Study 7 \n(NCT05004181), immunogenicity of a single 30 mcg dose of a Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent COVID-19 vaccine \ncontaining equal quantities of modRNA encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein for the Alpha and Delta \nSARS-CoV-2 variants [not authorized or approved in the U.S., hereafter referred to as bivalent vaccine (Alpha \nand Delta)] was assessed in COVID-19 vaccine-naïve participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection (n = 262) compared to participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received 2 doses of \nCOMIRNATY in Study 2 (n = 275). Among Study 7 participants, 253 were from study sites in South Africa \nand 9 were from study sites in the U.S. The immunogenicity of the bivalent Alpha and Delta vaccine is relevant \nto COMIRNATY because these vaccines are manufactured using the same process with differences only in the \nencoded spike proteins. \n \nTable 10 presents demographic characteristics for participants in the immunogenicity analysis set.  \n \n \n22 \nTable 10:  Demographic Characteristics – Subset of Participants from Study 7 and Study 2 – Reference \nStrain Neutralization – Immunogenicity Analysis Set   \n \nStudy 7 \nSingle Dose of Bivalent Vaccine \n(Alpha and Delta) \nWith Evidence of Prior Infection \n(Na=262) \nNb (%) \nStudy 2 \nTwo Doses of \nCOMIRNATY* \nWithout Evidence of \nInfection \n(Na=275) \nNb (%) \nSex \nMale \n109 (41.6) \n113 (41.1) \nFemale \n153 (58.4) \n162 (58.9) \nAge at Vaccination (Years) \nMean (SD) \n42.9 (16.21) \n42.7 (16.08) \nMedian \n41.0 \n40.0 \nMin, max \n(18,84) \n(18, 84) \nRace \nWhite \n4 (1.5) \n230 (83.6) \nBlack or African American \n169 (64.5) \n25 (9.1) \nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native \n0 \n2 (0.7) \nAsian \n0 \n7 (2.5) \nOtherc \n89 (34.0) \n11 (4.0) \nEthnicity \nHispanic or Latino \n5 (1.9) \n83 (30.2) \nNot Hispanic or Latino \n255 (97.3) \n192 (69.8) \nNot reported \n2 (0.8) \n0 \n* Vaccine encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (Original). \na.

Noninferiority of the \nseroresponse rate to the reference strain was not met, as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CIs for the \ndifference in seroresponse rate of reference strain was -10.04%, below the noninferiority margin of -10% \n(Table 12). \n \n \n23 \nTable 11: Geometric Mean Ratios – Single Dose of Bivalent Vaccine (Alpha and Delta) in Vaccine-Naïve \nParticipants from Study 7 With Evidence of Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection Compared to \n2 Doses of COMIRNATY in a Subset of Participants from Study 2 Without Evidence of \nSARS-CoV-2 Infection – Reference Strain Neutralization – Immunogenicity Analysis Set \n \nStudy 7 \nSingle Dose of Bivalent \nVaccine (Alpha and Delta)  \nWith Evidence of Prior \nInfectiona  \n3 Weeks After Dose 1b \nStudy 2 \nTwo Doses of \nCOMIRNATY*  \nWithout Evidence of \nInfectionc  \n1 Month After Dose 2b \nBivalent Vaccine (Alpha \nand Delta) With Evidence \nof Prior Infectionb /  \nCOMIRNATY  \nWithout Evidence of \nInfectionc \nSARS-CoV-2 \nNeutralization \nAssay \nnd \nGMTe \n(95% CIe) \nnd \nGMTe \n(95% CIe) \nGMRf  \n(95% CIf) \nReference \nstrain - NT50 \n(titer)g \n262 \n17404.2  \n(15485.1, 19561.1) \n275 \n1328.1  \n(1183.1, 1491.0) \n13.12  \n(11.14, 15.45)h \nAbbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titer; LLOQ = lower limit of \nquantitation; N-binding = SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein–binding; NAAT = nucleic acid amplification test; NT50 = 50% neutralizing \ntiter; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. \n* \nVaccine encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (Original). \na.

Randomization was \nstratified by age: 12 through 15 years of age, 16 through 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a \nminimum of 40% of participants in the ≥56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were \nimmunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. \nParticipants with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or \nhospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrollment, were included as were participants \nwith known stable infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B virus (HBV).  \n \n \n25 \nIn Study 2, based on data accrued through March 13, 2021, approximately 44,000 participants 12 years of age \nand older were randomized equally and received 2 doses of COMIRNATY or placebo. Participants are planned \nto be followed for up to 24 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19.  \n \nOverall, among the total participants who received COMIRNATY or placebo, 51.4% or 50.3% were male and \n48.6% or 49.7% were female, 79.1% or 79.2% were 16 through 64 years of age, 20.9% or 20.8% were 65 years \nof age and older, 81.9% or 82.1% were White, 9.5% or 9.6% were Black or African American, 1.0% or 0.9% \nwere American Indian or Alaska Native, 4.4% or 4.3% were Asian, 0.3% or 0.2% Native Hawaiian or other \nPacific Islander, 25.6% or 25.4% were Hispanic/Latino, 73.9% or 74.1% were non-Hispanic/Latino, 0.5% or \n0.5% did not report ethnicity, 46.0% or 45.7% had comorbidities [participants who have 1 or more \ncomorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease: defined as subjects who had at least 1 of the \nCharlson comorbidity index category or body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2], respectively. The mean age at \nvaccination was 49.8 or 49.7 years and median age was 51.0 or 51.0 in participants who received \nCOMIRNATY or placebo, respectively.  \n \nEfficacy Against COVID-19 \n \nThe population for the analysis of the protocol pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint included \n36,621 participants 12 years of age and older (18,242 in the COMIRNATY group and 18,379 in the placebo \ngroup) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. \nThe population in the protocol pre-specified primary efficacy analysis included all participants 12 years of age \nand older who had been enrolled from July 27, 2020, and followed for the development of COVID-19 through \nNovember 14, 2020. Participants 18 through 55 years of age and 56 years of age and older began enrollment \nfrom July 27, 2020, 16 through 17 years of age began enrollment from September 16, 2020, and 12 through \n15 years of age began enrollment from October 15, 2020.  \n \nFor participants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to 7 days after Dose 2, vaccine efficacy \nagainst confirmed COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after Dose 2 was 95.0% (95% credible interval: 90.3, \n97.6), which met the pre-specified success criterion. The case split was 8 COVID-19 cases in the \nCOMIRNATY group compared to 162 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group.  \n \nThe population for the updated vaccine efficacy analysis included participants 16 years of age and older who \nhad been enrolled from July 27, 2020, and followed for the development of COVID-19 during blinded \nplacebo-controlled follow-up through March 13, 2021, representing up to 6 months of follow-up after Dose 2. \nThere were 12,796 (60.8%) participants in the COMIRNATY group and 12,449 (58.7%) in the placebo group \nfollowed for ≥4 months after Dose 2 in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period.  \n \nSARS-CoV-2 variants of concern identified from COVID-19 cases for this age group from this data cutoff \ninclude B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 (Beta).

If you have \nquestions or would like more information, please talk with your healthcare provider. \nWhat is COMIRNATY? \nCOMIRNATY is a vaccine for use in people 12 years of age and older to protect against \nCOVID-19. \n \nCOMIRNATY may not protect all people who receive the vaccine. \n \nCOMIRNATY does not contain SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. COMIRNATY \ncannot give you COVID-19. \nWho should not get COMIRNATY? \nYou should not get COMIRNATY if you had: \n• a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of COMIRNATY or any Pfizer-BioNTech \nCOVID-19 vaccine \n• a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in these vaccines (see What are the \ningredients in COMIRNATY?). \nBefore getting COMIRNATY, tell your vaccination provider about all of your medical \nconditions, including if you: \n• have any allergies  \n• had a severe allergic reaction after receiving a previous dose of any COVID-19 vaccine \n• have had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the \nlining outside the heart) \n• have a fever \n• have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner \n• are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects your immune system \n• are pregnant or plan to become pregnant \n• are breastfeeding \n• have received another COVID-19 vaccine \n• have ever fainted in association with an injection \nHow is COMIRNATY given? \nCOMIRNATY is given as an injection into the muscle. \n2 \nWhat are the possible risks of COMIRNATY? \nThere is a remote chance that COMIRNATY could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe \nallergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose. For this \nreason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place where you received your \nvaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include: \n• Difficulty breathing \n• Swelling of your face and throat \n• A fast heartbeat \n• A bad rash all over your body \n• Dizziness and weakness \n \nMyocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside \nthe heart) have occurred in some people who have received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, including \nCOMIRNATY and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. Myocarditis and pericarditis following \nCOMIRNATY have occurred most commonly in adolescent males 12 through 17 years of age. In \nmost of these individuals, symptoms began within a few days following vaccination. The chance of \nhaving this occur is very low. You should seek medical attention right away if you or your child \nhave any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine, particularly during the 2 weeks \nafter receiving a dose of the vaccine:  \n• Chest pain \n• Shortness of breath \n• Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart \n \nSide effects that have been reported with COMIRNATY or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines \ninclude:  \n• Severe allergic reactions \n• Non-severe allergic reactions such as rash, itching, hives, or swelling of the face \n• Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) \n• Pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) \n• Injection site reactions: pain, swelling, redness, arm pain \n• General side effects: tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, nausea, \nfeeling unwell, swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), decreased appetite, diarrhea, \nvomiting, dizziness \n• Fainting in association with injection of the vaccine \n \nThese may not be all the possible side effects of COMIRNATY. Ask your healthcare provider about \nany side effects that concern you. \n \nReport vaccine side effects to FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The \nVAERS toll-free number is 1-800-822-7967 or report online to \nhttps://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html.  \n \nIn addition, you can report side effects to Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or \nwww.pfizersafetyreporting.com. \nWhat if you are pregnant or breastfeeding?  \nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, discuss your options with your healthcare provider. \n3 \nWhat are the ingredients in COMIRNATY? \nCOMIRNATY contains the following ingredients: \n• messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) \n• lipids (((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), \n2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-\nphosphocholine, and cholesterol) \n• tromethamine \n• tromethamine hydrochloride \n• sucrose \n \nCOMIRNATY does not contain preservatives. \n \nThis Information for Recipients and Caregivers may have been updated.

Women \nwho receive GARDASIL should continue to undergo cervical cancer screening per standard of care. [See \nPatient Counseling Information (17).] \nRecipients of GARDASIL should not discontinue anal cancer screening if it has been recommended by \na health care provider. [See Patient Counseling Information (17).] \nGARDASIL has not been demonstrated to provide protection against disease from vaccine and non-\nvaccine HPV types to which a person has previously been exposed through sexual activity. [See Clinical \nStudies (14.4, 14.5).]   \nGARDASIL is not intended to be used for treatment of active external genital lesions; cervical, vulvar, \nvaginal, and anal cancers; CIN; VIN; VaIN; or AIN.   \nGARDASIL has not been demonstrated to protect against diseases due to HPV types not contained in \nthe vaccine. [See Clinical Studies (14.4, 14.5).] \nNot all vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers are caused by HPV, and GARDASIL protects only against those \nvulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers caused by HPV 16 and 18. \nGARDASIL does not protect against genital diseases not caused by HPV. \nVaccination with GARDASIL may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients. \nGARDASIL has not been demonstrated to prevent HPV-related CIN 2/3 or worse in women older than \n26 years of age. [See Clinical Studies (14.7).] \n \n3 \n \n2 \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \n2.1 \nDosage \nGARDASIL should be administered intramuscularly as a 0.5-mL dose at the following schedule: 0, 2 \nmonths, 6 months. [See Clinical Studies (14.8).] \n2.2 \nMethod of Administration \nFor intramuscular use only. \nShake well before use. Thorough agitation immediately before administration is necessary to maintain \nsuspension of the vaccine. GARDASIL should not be diluted or mixed with other vaccines. After thorough \nagitation, GARDASIL is a white, cloudy liquid. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for \nparticulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use the product if particulates are present \nor if it appears discolored. \nGARDASIL should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid region of the upper arm or in the higher \nanterolateral area of the thigh.   \nSyncope has been reported following vaccination with GARDASIL and may result in falling with injury; \nobservation for 15 minutes after administration is recommended. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] \nSingle-Dose Vial Use \nWithdraw the 0.5-mL dose of vaccine from the single-dose vial using a sterile needle and syringe and \nuse promptly.  \nPrefilled Syringe Use  \nThis package does not contain a needle. Shake well before use. Attach the needle by twisting in a \nclockwise direction until the needle fits securely on the syringe. Administer the entire dose as per standard \nprotocol. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \nGARDASIL is a suspension for intramuscular administration available in 0.5-mL single dose vials and \nprefilled syringes. See Description (11) for the complete listing of ingredients. \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \nHypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast (a vaccine component), or after a previous \ndose of GARDASIL. [See Description (11).] \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n5.1 \nSyncope \nBecause vaccinees may develop syncope, sometimes resulting in falling with injury, observation for \n15 minutes after administration is recommended. Syncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic \nmovements and other seizure-like activity, has been reported following vaccination with GARDASIL. When \nsyncope is associated with tonic-clonic movements, the activity is usually transient and typically responds \nto restoring cerebral perfusion by maintaining a supine or Trendelenburg position. \n5.2 \nManaging Allergic Reactions  \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision must be readily available in case of anaphylactic \nreactions following the administration of GARDASIL. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS \nOverall Summary of Adverse Reactions \nHeadache, fever, nausea, and dizziness; and local injection site reactions (pain, swelling, erythema, \npruritus, and bruising) occurred after administration with GARDASIL. \nSyncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic movements and other seizure-like activity, has been \nreported following vaccination with GARDASIL and may result in falling with injury; observation for \n15 minutes after administration is recommended. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] \nAnaphylaxis has been reported following vaccination with GARDASIL.  \n \n4 \n \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed \nin the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine \nand may not reflect the rates observed in practice.  \nStudies in Girls and Women (9 Through 45 Years of Age) and Boys and Men (9 Through 26 Years of \nAge) \nIn 7 clinical trials (5 Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate [AAHS]-controlled, 1 saline \nplacebo-controlled, and 1 uncontrolled), 18,083 individuals were administered GARDASIL or AAHS control \nor saline placebo on the day of enrollment, and approximately 2 and 6 months thereafter, and safety was \nevaluated using vaccination report cards (VRC)-aided surveillance for 14 days after each injection of \nGARDASIL or AAHS control or saline placebo in these individuals. The individuals who were monitored \nusing VRC-aided surveillance included 10,088 individuals 9 through 45 years of age at enrollment who \nreceived GARDASIL and 7,995 individuals who received AAHS control or saline placebo. Few individuals \n(0.2%) discontinued due to adverse reactions.

Because these events were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not \npossible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.   \n \n10 \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic \npurpura, lymphadenopathy.  \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Pulmonary embolus. \nGastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting. \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Asthenia, chills, death, fatigue, malaise, injection-\nsite nodule.  \nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders: \nAutoimmune \ndiseases, \nhypersensitivity \nreactions \nincluding \nanaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, bronchospasm, and urticaria. \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Arthralgia, myalgia. \nNervous system disorders: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, dizziness, Guillain-Barré syndrome, \nheadache, motor neuron disease, paralysis, seizures, syncope (including syncope associated with tonic-\nclonic movements and other seizure-like activity) sometimes resulting in falling with injury, transverse \nmyelitis.  \nInfections and infestations: Cellulitis. \nVascular disorders: Deep venous thrombosis. \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS \n7.1 \nUse with RECOMBIVAX HB \nResults from clinical studies indicate that GARDASIL may be administered concomitantly (at a separate \ninjection site) with RECOMBIVAX HB [hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant)] [see Clinical Studies (14.10)].  \n7.2 \nUse with Menactra and Adacel \nResults from clinical studies indicate that GARDASIL may be administered concomitantly (at a separate \ninjection site) with Menactra [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid \nConjugate Vaccine] and Adacel [Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis \nVaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)] [see Clinical Studies (14.11)]. \n7.3 \nUse with Hormonal Contraceptives \nIn clinical studies of 16- through 26-year-old women, 13,912 (GARDASIL N = 6952; AAHS control or \nsaline placebo N = 6960) who had post-Month 7 follow-up used hormonal contraceptives for a total of \n33,859 person-years (65.8% of the total follow-up time in the studies).  \nIn one clinical study of 24- through 45-year-old women, 1357 (GARDASIL N = 690; AAHS control N = \n667) who had post-Month 7 follow-up used hormonal contraceptives for a total of 3400 person-years (31.5% \nof the total follow-up time in the study). Use of hormonal contraceptives or lack of use of hormonal \ncontraceptives among study participants did not impair the immune response in the per protocol \nimmunogenicity (PPI) population. \n7.4 \nUse with Systemic Immunosuppressive Medications \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, \nand corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune responses to \nvaccines [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].  \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n8.1 \nPregnancy  \nPregnancy Category B  \nReproduction studies have been performed in female rats at doses equivalent to the recommended \nhuman dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired female fertility or harm to the fetus due to \nGARDASIL. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because \nanimal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human responses, GARDASIL should be used \nduring pregnancy only if clearly needed.   \nAn evaluation of the effect of GARDASIL on embryo-fetal, pre- and postweaning development was \nconducted using rats. One group of rats was administered GARDASIL twice prior to gestation, during the \nperiod of organogenesis (gestation Day 6) and on lactation Day 7. A second group of pregnant rats was \nadministered GARDASIL during the period of organogenesis (gestation Day 6) and on lactation Day 7 only. \n \n11 \n \nGARDASIL was administered at 0.5 mL/rat/occasion (120 mcg total protein which is equivalent to the \nrecommended human dose) by intramuscular injection. No adverse effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy, \nparturition, lactation, embryo-fetal or pre- and postweaning development were observed. There were no \nvaccine-related fetal malformations or other evidence of teratogenesis noted in this study. In addition, there \nwere no treatment-related effects on developmental signs, behavior, reproductive performance, or fertility \nof the offspring.  \nClinical Studies in Humans \nIn clinical studies, women underwent urine pregnancy testing prior to administration of each dose of \nGARDASIL. Women who were found to be pregnant before completion of a 3-dose regimen of GARDASIL \nwere instructed to defer completion of their vaccination regimen until resolution of the pregnancy.  \nGARDASIL is not indicated for women 27 years of age or older. However, safety data in women 16 \nthrough 45 years of age was collected, and 3819 women (GARDASIL N = 1894 vs. AAHS control or saline \nplacebo N = 1925) reported at least 1 pregnancy each. \nThe overall proportions of pregnancies that resulted in an adverse outcome, defined as the combined \nnumbers of spontaneous abortion, late fetal death, and congenital anomaly cases out of the total number \nof pregnancy outcomes for which an outcome was known (and excluding elective terminations), were 22.6% \n(446/1973) in women who received GARDASIL and 23.1% (460/1994) in women who received AAHS \ncontrol or saline placebo. \nOverall, 55 and 65 women in the group that received GARDASIL or AAHS control or saline placebo, \nrespectively (2.9% and 3.4% of all women who reported a pregnancy in the respective vaccination groups), \nexperienced a serious adverse reaction during pregnancy. The most common events reported were \nconditions that can result in Caesarean section (e.g., failure of labor, malpresentation, cephalopelvic \ndisproportion), premature onset of labor (e.g., threatened abortions, premature rupture of membranes), and \npregnancy-related medical problems (e.g., pre-eclampsia, hyperemesis). The proportions of pregnant \nwomen who experienced such events were comparable between the groups receiving GARDASIL and \nAAHS control or saline placebo. \nThere were 45 cases of congenital anomaly in pregnancies that occurred in women who received \nGARDASIL and 34 cases of congenital anomaly in pregnancies that occurred in women who received \nAAHS control or saline placebo. \nFurther sub-analyses were conducted to evaluate pregnancies with estimated onset within 30 days or \nmore than 30 days from administration of a dose of GARDASIL or AAHS control or saline placebo. For \npregnancies with estimated onset within 30 days of vaccination, 5 cases of congenital anomaly were \nobserved in the group that received GARDASIL compared to 1 case of congenital anomaly in the group \nthat received AAHS control or saline placebo. The congenital anomalies seen in pregnancies with estimated \nonset within 30 days of vaccination included pyloric stenosis, congenital megacolon, congenital \nhydronephrosis, hip dysplasia, and club foot. Conversely, in pregnancies with onset more than 30 days \nfollowing vaccination, 40 cases of congenital anomaly were observed in the group that received GARDASIL \ncompared with 33 cases of congenital anomaly in the group that received AAHS control or saline placebo.  \nWomen who receive GARDASIL during pregnancy are encouraged to contact Merck Sharp & \nDohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or VAERS at 1-800-822-7967 or www.vaers.hhs.gov . \n8.3 \nNursing Mothers \nWomen 16 Through 45 Years of Age \nIt is not known whether GARDASIL is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in \nhuman milk, caution should be exercised when GARDASIL is administered to a nursing woman. \nGARDASIL or AAHS control were given to a total of 1133 women (vaccine N = 582, AAHS control N = \n551) during the relevant Phase 3 clinical studies. \nOverall, 27 and 13 infants of women who received GARDASIL or AAHS control, respectively \n(representing 4.6% and 2.4% of the total number of women who were breast-feeding during the period in \nwhich they received GARDASIL or AAHS control, respectively), experienced a serious adverse reaction. \nIn a post-hoc analysis of clinical studies, a higher number of breast-feeding infants (n = 7) whose \nmothers received GARDASIL had acute respiratory illnesses within 30 days post vaccination of the mother \nas compared to infants (n = 2) whose mothers received AAHS control.  \n8.4 \nPediatric Use \nSafety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients below 9 years of age. \n \n12 \n \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use \nThe safety and effectiveness of GARDASIL have not been evaluated in a geriatric population, defined \nas individuals aged 65 years and over.  \n8.6 \nImmunocompromised Individuals \nThe immunologic response to GARDASIL may be diminished in immunocompromised individuals [see \nDrug Interactions (7.4)]. \n10 \nOVERDOSAGE  \nThere have been reports of administration of higher than recommended doses of GARDASIL.   \nIn general, the adverse event profile reported with overdose was comparable to recommended single \ndoses of GARDASIL.  \n11 \nDESCRIPTION \nGARDASIL, Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant, is a \nnon-infectious recombinant quadrivalent vaccine prepared from the purified virus-like particles (VLPs) of \nthe major capsid (L1) protein of HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18. The L1 proteins are produced by separate \nfermentations in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae and self-assembled into VLPs. The fermentation \nprocess involves growth of S. cerevisiae on chemically-defined fermentation media which include vitamins, \namino acids, mineral salts, and carbohydrates. The VLPs are released from the yeast cells by cell disruption \nand purified by a series of chemical and physical methods. The purified VLPs are adsorbed on preformed \naluminum-containing adjuvant (Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate). The quadrivalent HPV \nVLP vaccine is a sterile liquid suspension that is prepared by combining the adsorbed VLPs of each HPV \ntype and additional amounts of the aluminum-containing adjuvant and the final purification buffer. \nGARDASIL is a sterile suspension for intramuscular administration. Each 0.5-mL dose contains \napproximately 20 mcg of HPV 6 L1 protein, 40 mcg of HPV 11 L1 protein, 40 mcg of HPV 16 L1 protein, \nand 20 mcg of HPV 18 L1 protein. \nEach 0.5-mL dose of the vaccine contains approximately 225 mcg of aluminum (as Amorphous \nAluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate adjuvant), 9.56 mg of sodium chloride, 0.78 mg of L-histidine, 50 mcg \nof polysorbate 80, 35 mcg of sodium borate, <7 mcg yeast protein/dose, and water for injection. The product \ndoes not contain a preservative or antibiotics.  \nAfter thorough agitation, GARDASIL is a white, cloudy liquid. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n12.1 Mechanism of Action \nHPV only infects human beings. Animal studies with analogous animal papillomaviruses suggest that \nthe efficacy of L1 VLP vaccines may involve the development of humoral immune responses. Human \nbeings develop a humoral immune response to the vaccine, although the exact mechanism of protection is \nunknown.  \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nGARDASIL has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. \nGARDASIL administered to female rats at a dose of 120 mcg total protein, which is equivalent to the \nrecommended human dose, had no effects on mating performance, fertility, or embryonic/fetal survival.  \nThe effect of GARDASIL on male fertility has been studied in male rats at an intramuscular dose of 0.5 \nmL/rat/occasion (120 mcg total protein which is equivalent to the recommended human dose). One group \nof male rats was administered GARDASIL once, 3 days prior to cohabitation, and a second group of male \nrats was administered GARDASIL three times, at 6 weeks, 3 weeks, and 3 days prior to cohabitation. There \nwere no treatment-related effects on reproductive performance including fertility, sperm count, and sperm \nmotility. There were no treatment-related gross or histomorphologic and weight changes on the testes. \n \n13 \n \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES \nCIN 2/3 and AIS are the immediate and necessary precursors of squamous cell carcinoma and \nadenocarcinoma of the cervix, respectively. Their detection and removal has been shown to prevent cancer; \nthus, they serve as surrogate markers for prevention of cervical cancer. In the clinical studies in girls and \nwomen aged 16 through 26 years, cases of CIN 2/3 and AIS were the efficacy endpoints to assess \nprevention of cervical cancer. In addition, cases of VIN 2/3 and VaIN 2/3 were the efficacy endpoints to \nassess prevention of HPV-related vulvar and vaginal cancers, and observations of external genital lesions \nwere the efficacy endpoints for the prevention of genital warts. \nIn clinical studies in boys and men aged 16 through 26 years, efficacy was evaluated using the following \nendpoints: external genital warts and penile/perineal/perianal intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) grades 1/2/3 \nor penile/perineal/perianal cancer. In addition, cases of AIN grades 1/2/3 and anal cancer made up the \ncomposite efficacy endpoint used to assess prevention of HPV-related anal cancer.  \nAnal HPV infection, AIN, and anal cancer were not endpoints in the studies conducted in women. The \nsimilarity of HPV-related anal disease in men and women supports bridging the indication of prevention of \nAIN and anal cancer to women.   \nEfficacy was assessed in 6 AAHS-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. \nThe first Phase 2 study evaluated the HPV 16 component of GARDASIL (Study 1, N = 2391 16- through \n26-year-old girls and women) and the second evaluated all components of GARDASIL (Study 2, N = 551 \n16- through 26-year-old girls and women). Two Phase 3 studies evaluated GARDASIL in 5442 (Study 3) \nand 12,157 (Study 4) 16- through 26-year-old girls and women. A third Phase 3 study, Study 5, evaluated \nGARDASIL in 4055 16- through 26-year-old boys and men, including a subset of 598 (GARDASIL = 299; \nplacebo = 299) men who self-identified as having sex with men (MSM population). A fourth Phase 3 study, \nStudy 6, evaluated GARDASIL in 3817 24- through 45-year-old women. Together, these six studies \nevaluated 28,413 individuals (20,541 girls and women 16 through 26 years of age at enrollment with a \nmean age of 20.0 years, 4055 boys and men 16 through 26 years of age at enrollment with a mean age of \n20.5 years, and 3817 women 24 through 45 years of age at enrollment with a mean age of 34.3 years). The \nrace distribution of the 16- through 26-year-old girls and women in the clinical trials was as follows: 70.4% \nWhite; 12.2% Hispanic (Black and White); 8.8% Other; 4.6% Black; 3.8% Asian; and 0.2% American Indian. \nThe race distribution of the 16- through 26-year-old boys and men in the clinical trials was as follows: 35.2% \nWhite; 20.5% Hispanic (Black and White); 14.4% Other; 19.8% Black; 10.0% Asian; and 0.1% American \nIndian. The race distribution of the 24- through 45-year-old women in the clinical trials was as follows: 20.6% \nWhite; 43.2% Hispanic (Black and White); 0.2% Other; 4.8% Black; 31.2% Asian; and 0.1% American \nIndian. \nThe median duration of follow-up was 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.3, and 4.0 years for Study 1, Study 2, Study \n3, Study 4, Study 5, and Study 6, respectively. Individuals received vaccine or AAHS control on the day of \nenrollment and 2 and 6 months thereafter. Efficacy was analyzed for each study individually and for all \nstudies in girls and women combined according to a prospective clinical plan.  \nOverall, 73% of 16- through 26-year-old girls and women, 67% of 24- through 45-year-old women, and \n83% of 16- through 26-year-old boys and men were naïve (i.e., PCR [Polymerase Chain Reaction] negative \nand seronegative for all 4 vaccine HPV types) to all 4 vaccine HPV types at enrollment.   \nA total of 27% of 16- through 26-year-old girls and women, 33% of 24- through 45-year-old women, and \n17% of 16- through 26-year-old boys and men had evidence of prior exposure to or ongoing infection with \nat least 1 of the 4 vaccine HPV types. Among these individuals, 74% of 16- through 26-year-old girls and \nwomen, 71% of 24- through 45-year-old women, and 78% of 16- through 26-year-old boys and men had \nevidence of prior exposure to or ongoing infection with only 1 of the 4 vaccine HPV types and were naïve \n(PCR negative and seronegative) to the remaining 3 types. \nIn 24- through 45-year-old individuals, 0.4% had been exposed to all 4 vaccine HPV types.  \nIn individuals who were naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) to all 4 vaccine HPV types, CIN, genital \nwarts, VIN, VaIN, PIN, and persistent infection caused by any of the 4 vaccine HPV types were counted as \nendpoints.  \nAmong individuals who were positive (PCR positive and/or seropositive) for a vaccine HPV type at Day \n1, endpoints related to that type were not included in the analyses of prophylactic efficacy. Endpoints related \nto the remaining types for which the individual was naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) were counted.  \nFor example, in individuals who were HPV 18 positive (PCR positive and/or seropositive) at Day 1, \nlesions caused by HPV 18 were not counted in the prophylactic efficacy evaluations. Lesions caused by \n \n14 \n \nHPV 6, 11, and 16 were included in the prophylactic efficacy evaluations. The same approach was used \nfor the other types. \n14.1 Prophylactic Efficacy – HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in Girls and Women 16 through 26 Years \nof Age  \nGARDASIL was administered without prescreening for presence of HPV infection and the efficacy trials \nallowed enrollment of girls and women regardless of baseline HPV status (i.e., PCR status or serostatus). \nGirls and women with current or prior HPV infection with an HPV type contained in the vaccine were not \neligible for prophylactic efficacy evaluations for that type. \nThe primary analyses of efficacy with respect to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 were conducted in the per-\nprotocol efficacy (PPE) population, consisting of girls and women who received all 3 vaccinations within 1 \nyear of enrollment, did not have major deviations from the study protocol, and were naïve (PCR negative \nin cervicovaginal specimens and seronegative) to the relevant HPV type(s) (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) prior \nto dose 1 and through 1 month postdose 3 (Month 7). Efficacy was measured starting after the Month 7 \nvisit. \nGARDASIL was efficacious in reducing the incidence of CIN (any grade including CIN 2/3); AIS; genital \nwarts; VIN (any grade); and VaIN (any grade) related to vaccine HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 in those who \nwere PCR negative and seronegative at baseline (Table 11). \nIn addition, girls and women who were already infected with 1 or more vaccine-related HPV types prior \nto vaccination were protected from precancerous cervical lesions and external genital lesions caused by \nthe other vaccine HPV types. \n \n \n15 \n \nTable 11: Analysis of Efficacy of GARDASIL in the PPE* Population† of 16- Through 26-Year-Old Girls and Women for \nVaccine HPV Types \nPopulation \nGARDASIL \nAAHS Control \n% Efficacy (95% CI) \nN \nNumber of cases \nN \nNumber of cases \nHPV 16- or 18-related CIN 2/3 or AIS \nStudy 1‡ \n755 \n0 \n750 \n12 \n100.0 (65.1, 100.0) \nStudy 2 \n231 \n0 \n230 \n1 \n100.0 (-3744.9, 100.0) \nStudy 3 \n2201 \n0 \n2222 \n36 \n100.0 (89.2, 100.0) \nStudy 4 \n5306 \n2 \n5262 \n63 \n96.9 (88.2, 99.6) \nCombined Protocols§ \n8493 \n2 \n8464 \n112 \n98.2 (93.5, 99.8) \nHPV 16-related CIN 2/3 or AIS \nCombined Protocols§ \n7402 \n2 \n7205 \n93 \n97.9 (92.3, 99.8) \nHPV 18-related CIN 2/3 or AIS \nCombined Protocols§ \n7382 \n0 \n7316 \n29 \n100.0 (86.6, 100.0) \nHPV 16- or 18-related VIN 2/3 \nStudy 2 \n231 \n0 \n230 \n0 \nNot calculated \nStudy 3 \n2219 \n0 \n2239 \n6 \n100.0 (14.4, 100.0) \nStudy 4 \n5322 \n0 \n5275 \n4 \n100.0 (-50.3, 100.0) \nCombined Protocols§ \n7772 \n0 \n7744 \n10 \n100.0 (55.5, 100.0) \nHPV 16- or 18-related VaIN 2/3 \nStudy 2 \n231 \n0 \n230 \n0 \nNot calculated \nStudy 3 \n2219 \n0 \n2239 \n5 \n100.0 (-10.1, 100.0) \nStudy 4 \n5322 \n0 \n5275 \n4 \n100.0 (-50.3, 100.0) \nCombined Protocols§ \n7772 \n0 \n7744 \n9 \n100.0 (49.5, 100.0) \nHPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related CIN (CIN 1, CIN 2/3) or AIS \nStudy 2 \n235 \n0 \n233 \n3 \n100.0 (-138.4, 100.0) \nStudy 3 \n2241 \n0 \n2258 \n77 \n100.0 (95.1, 100.0) \nStudy 4 \n5388 \n9 \n5374 \n145 \n93.8 (88.0, 97.2) \nCombined Protocols§ \n7864 \n9 \n7865 \n225 \n96.0 (92.3, 98.2) \nHPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related Genital Warts \nStudy 2 \n235 \n0 \n233 \n3 \n100.0 (-139.5, 100.0) \nStudy 3 \n2261 \n0 \n2279 \n58 \n100.0 (93.5, 100.0) \nStudy 4 \n5404 \n2 \n5390 \n132 \n98.5 (94.5, 99.8) \nCombined Protocols§ \n7900 \n2 \n7902 \n193 \n99.0 (96.2, 99.9) \nHPV 6- and 11-related Genital Warts \nCombined Protocols§ \n6932 \n2 \n6856 \n189 \n99.0 (96.2, 99.9) \n*The PPE population consisted of individuals who received all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrollment, did not have major deviations \nfrom the study protocol, and were naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) to the relevant HPV type(s) (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) prior \nto dose 1 and through 1 month postdose 3 (Month 7). \n†See Table 14 for analysis of vaccine impact in the general population. \n‡Evaluated only the HPV 16 L1 VLP vaccine component of GARDASIL \n§Analyses of the combined trials were prospectively planned and included the use of similar study entry criteria. \nN = Number of individuals with at least 1 follow-up visit after Month 7 \nCI = Confidence Interval  \nNote 1: Point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person-time of follow-up. \nNote 2: The first analysis in the table (i.e., HPV 16- or 18-related CIN 2/3, AIS or worse) was the primary endpoint of the vaccine \ndevelopment plan. \nNote 3: Table 11 does not include cases due to non-vaccine HPV types. \nAAHS Control = Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate \n \nProphylactic efficacy against overall cervical and genital disease related to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 in an \nextension phase of Study 2, that included data through Month 60, was noted to be 100% (95% CI: 12.3%, \n100.0%) among girls and women in the per protocol population naïve to the relevant HPV types.  \nGARDASIL was efficacious against HPV disease caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in girls and \nwomen who were naïve for those specific HPV types at baseline. \n14.2 Prophylactic Efficacy – HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in Boys and Men 16 through 26 Years of \nAge \nThe primary analyses of efficacy were conducted in the per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population.

Cross-protective \nefficacy was not demonstrated against disease caused by non-vaccine HPV types in the combined \ndatabase of the Study 3 and Study 4 trials. \n \n21 \n \nGARDASIL does not protect against genital disease not related to HPV. One woman who received \nGARDASIL in Study 3 developed an external genital well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma at Month \n24. No HPV DNA was detected in the lesion or in any other samples taken throughout the study. \nIn 18,150 girls and women enrolled in Study 2, Study 3, and Study 4, GARDASIL reduced definitive \ncervical therapy procedures by 23.9% (95% CI: 15.2%, 31.7%).  \n14.7 Studies in Women 27 through 45 Years of Age \nStudy 6 evaluated efficacy in 3253 women 27 through 45 years of age based on a combined endpoint \nof HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related persistent infection, genital warts, vulvar and vaginal dysplastic lesions of \nany grade, CIN of any grade, AIS, and cervical cancer. These women were randomized 1:1 to receive either \nGARDASIL or AAHS control. The efficacy for the combined endpoint was driven primarily by prevention of \npersistent infection. There was no statistically significant efficacy demonstrated for CIN 2/3, AIS, or cervical \ncancer. In post hoc analyses conducted to assess the impact of GARDASIL on the individual components \nof the combined endpoint, the results in the population of women naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline \nwere as follows: prevention of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related persistent infection (80.5% [95% CI: 68.3, \n88.6]), prevention of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related CIN (any grade) (85.8% [95% CI: 52.4, 97.3]), and \nprevention of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related genital warts (87.6% [95% CI: 7.3, 99.7]).  \nEfficacy for disease endpoints was diminished in a population impact assessment of women who were \nvaccinated regardless of baseline HPV status (full analysis set). In the full analysis set (FAS), efficacy was \nnot demonstrated for the following endpoints: prevention of HPV 16- and 18-related CIN 2/3, AIS, or cervical \ncancer and prevention of HPV 6- and 11-related condyloma. No efficacy was demonstrated against CIN \n2/3, AIS, or cervical cancer in the general population irrespective of HPV type (FAS any type analysis). \n14.8 Immunogenicity \nAssays to Measure Immune Response \nThe minimum anti-HPV titer that confers protective efficacy has not been determined. \nBecause there were few disease cases in individuals naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) to vaccine \nHPV types at baseline in the group that received GARDASIL, it has not been possible to establish minimum \nanti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 antibody levels that protect against clinical disease \ncaused by HPV 6, 11, 16, and/or 18.  \nThe immunogenicity of GARDASIL was assessed in 23,951 9- through 45-year-old girls and women \n(GARDASIL N = 12,634; AAHS control or saline placebo N = 11,317) and 5417 9- through 26-year-old boys \nand men (GARDASIL N = 3109; AAHS control or saline placebo N = 2308).  \nType-specific immunoassays with type-specific standards were used to assess immunogenicity to each \nvaccine HPV type. These assays measured antibodies against neutralizing epitopes for each HPV type. \nThe scales for these assays are unique to each HPV type; thus, comparisons across types and to other \nassays are not appropriate.  \nImmune Response to GARDASIL \nThe primary immunogenicity analyses were conducted in a per-protocol immunogenicity (PPI) \npopulation. This population consisted of individuals who were seronegative and PCR negative to the \nrelevant HPV type(s) at enrollment, remained HPV PCR negative to the relevant HPV type(s) through 1 \nmonth postdose 3 (Month 7), received all 3 vaccinations, and did not deviate from the study protocol in \nways that could interfere with the effects of the vaccine. \nImmunogenicity was measured by (1) the percentage of individuals who were seropositive for antibodies \nagainst the relevant vaccine HPV type, and (2) the Geometric Mean Titer (GMT).  \nIn clinical studies in 16- through 26-year-old girls and women, 99.8%, 99.8%, 99.8%, and 99.4% who \nreceived GARDASIL became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 seropositive, \nrespectively, by 1 month postdose 3 across all age groups tested.  \nIn clinical studies in 27- through 45-year-old women, 98.2%, 97.9%, 98.6%, and 97.1% who received \nGARDASIL became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 seropositive, respectively, by \n1 month postdose 3 across all age groups tested. \nIn clinical studies in 16- through 26-year-old boys and men, 98.9%, 99.2%, 98.8%, and 97.4% who \nreceived GARDASIL became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 seropositive, \nrespectively, by 1 month postdose 3 across all age groups tested.  \nAcross all populations, anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 GMTs peaked at Month \n7 (Table 18 and Table 19). GMTs declined through Month 24 and then stabilized through Month 36 at levels \n \n22 \n \nabove baseline. Tables 20 and 21 display the persistence of anti-HPV cLIA geometric mean titers by gender \nand age group.

An \ninterim analysis of the per-protocol effectiveness population included 1,902 subjects who completed the \nGARDASIL vaccination series within one year, were naïve to the relevant HPV type through 1 month \npostdose 3, had no protocol violations, and had follow-up data available. The median follow-up from initial \nvaccination was 6.7 years with a range of 2.8 to 8.4 years. No cases of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related CIN \n(any grade), AIS, cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, or vaginal cancer were observed over a total of 5,765 \nperson-years at risk. \nAn extension of a Phase 3 study (Study 7) in which 614 girls and 565 boys 9 through 15 years of age at \nenrollment were randomized to vaccination with GARDASIL actively followed subjects for endpoint cases \nof HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related persistent infection, CIN (any grade), AIS, VIN, VaIN, cervical cancer, \nvulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, and genital lesions from the initiation of sexual activity or age 16 onwards. \nAn interim analysis of the per-protocol effectiveness population included 246 girls and 168 boys who \ncompleted the GARDASIL vaccination series within one year, were seronegative to the relevant HPV type \nat initiation of the vaccination series, and had not initiated sexual activity prior to receiving the third dose of \nGARDASIL. The median follow-up, from the first dose of vaccine, was 7.2 years with a range of 0.5 to 8.5 \nyears. No cases of persistent infection of at least 12 months’ duration and no cases of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or \n18-related CIN (any grade), AIS, VIN, VaIN, cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, or genital \nlesions were observed over a total 1,105 person-years at risk. There were 4 cases of HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or \n18-related persistent infection of at least 6 months’ duration, including 3 cases related to HPV 16 and 1 \ncase related to HPV 6, none of which persisted to 12 months’ duration.  \nPersistence of the Immune Response  \nThe interim reports of the two extension studies described above included analyses of type-specific anti-\nHPV antibody titers at 9 years postdose 1 for girls and women 16 through 23 years of age at enrollment \n(range of 1,178 to 1,331 subjects with evaluable data across HPV types) and at 8 years postdose 1 for \nboys and girls 9 through 15 years of age at enrollment (range of 436 to 440 subjects with evaluable data \nacross HPV types). Anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs as measured by cLIA were decreased compared \nwith corresponding values at earlier time points, but the proportions of seropositive subjects ranged from \n88.4% to 94.4% for anti-HPV 6, from 89.1% to 95.5% for anti-HPV 11, from 96.8% to 99.1% for anti-HPV \n16, and from 60.0% to 64.1% for anti-HPV 18.  \n14.10 \nStudies with RECOMBIVAX HB [hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant)] \nThe safety and immunogenicity of co-administration of GARDASIL with RECOMBIVAX HB [hepatitis B \nvaccine (recombinant)] (same visit, injections at separate sites) were evaluated in a randomized, double-\nblind, study of 1871 women aged 16 through 24 years at enrollment. The race distribution of the girls and \nwomen in the clinical trial was as follows: 61.6% White; 1.6% Hispanic (Black and White); 23.8% Other; \n11.9% Black; 0.8% Asian; and 0.3% American Indian.  \nSubjects either received GARDASIL and RECOMBIVAX HB (n = 466), GARDASIL and RECOMBIVAX \nHB-matched placebo (n = 468), RECOMBIVAX HB and GARDASIL-matched placebo (n = 467) or \nRECOMBIVAX-matched placebo and GARDASIL-matched placebo (n = 470) at Day 1, Month 2 and Month \n6. Immunogenicity was assessed for all vaccines 1 month post completion of the vaccination series.  \nConcomitant administration of GARDASIL with RECOMBIVAX HB [hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant)] \ndid not interfere with the antibody response to any of the vaccine antigens when GARDASIL was given \nconcomitantly with RECOMBIVAX HB or separately. \n \n27 \n \n14.11 \nStudies with Menactra [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide \nDiphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine] and Adacel [Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and \nAcellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)] \nThe safety and immunogenicity of co-administration of GARDASIL with Menactra [Meningococcal \n(Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine] and Adacel [Tetanus \nToxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)] (same visit, \ninjections at separate sites) were evaluated in an open-labeled, randomized, controlled study of 1040 boys \nand girls 11 through 17 years of age at enrollment. The race distribution of the subjects in the clinical trial \nwas as follows: 77.7% White; 6.8% Hispanic (Black and White); 1.4% Multi-racial; 12.3% Black; 1.2% Asian; \n0.2% Indian; and 0.4% American Indian. \nOne group received GARDASIL in one limb and both Menactra and Adacel, as separate injections, in \nthe opposite limb concomitantly on Day 1 (n = 517). The second group received the first dose of GARDASIL \non Day 1 in one limb then Menactra and Adacel, as separate injections, at Month 1 in the opposite limb (n \n= 523). Subjects in both vaccination groups received the second dose of GARDASIL at Month 2 and the \nthird dose at Month 6. Immunogenicity was assessed for all vaccines 1 month post completion of the \nvaccination series (1 dose for Menactra and Adacel and 3 doses for GARDASIL).  \nConcomitant administration of GARDASIL with Menactra [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) \nPolysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine] and Adacel [Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria \nToxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)] did not interfere with the antibody response to \nany of the vaccine antigens when GARDASIL was given concomitantly with Menactra and Adacel or \nseparately. \n16 \nHOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING \nAll presentations for GARDASIL contain a suspension of 120 mcg L1 protein from HPV types 6, 11, 16, \nand 18 in a 0.5-mL dose.

HAVRIX is approved for use in persons 12 months of age and older. Primary \nimmunization should be administered at least 2 weeks prior to expected exposure to HAV. \n2 \n2 \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \n2.1 \nPreparation for Administration \nShake well before use. With thorough agitation, HAVRIX is a homogeneous, turbid, white \nsuspension. Do not administer if it appears otherwise. Parenteral drug products should be \ninspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever \nsolution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be \nadministered. Attach a sterile needle to the prefilled syringe and administer intramuscularly. \n2.2 \nAdministration \nHAVRIX should be administered by intramuscular injection only. HAVRIX should not be \nadministered in the gluteal region; such injections may result in suboptimal response. \nDo not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously. \n2.3 \nRecommended Dose and Schedule \nChildren and Adolescents (aged 12 months through 18 years) \nPrimary immunization for children and adolescents consists of a single 0.5-mL dose and a 0.5-\nmL booster dose administered anytime between 6 and 12 months later. The preferred sites for \nintramuscular injections are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in young children or the deltoid \nmuscle of the upper arm in older children. \nAdults (aged 19 years and older) \nPrimary immunization for adults consists of a single 1-mL dose and a 1-mL booster dose \nadministered anytime between 6 and 12 months later. In adults, the injection should be given in \nthe deltoid region. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \nSuspension for injection available in the following presentations: \n• 0.5-mL single-dose prefilled TIP-LOK syringes. \n• 1-mL single-dose prefilled TIP-LOK syringes. [See How Supplied/Storage and Handling \n(16).] \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \nSevere allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any hepatitis A-containing \nvaccine, or to any component of HAVRIX, including neomycin, is a contraindication to \nadministration of HAVRIX [see Description (11)]. \n3 \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n5.1 \nSyncope \nSyncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including \nHAVRIX. Syncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual \ndisturbance, paresthesia, and tonic-clonic limb movements. Procedures should be in place to \navoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope. \n5.2 \nPreventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible \nanaphylactic reactions following administration of the vaccine [see Contraindications (4)]. \n5.3 \nAltered Immunocompetence \nImmunocompromised persons may have a diminished immune response to HAVRIX, including \nindividuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy. \n5.4 \nLimitations of Vaccine Effectiveness \nHepatitis A virus has a relatively long incubation period (15 to 50 days). HAVRIX may not \nprevent hepatitis A infection in individuals who have an unrecognized hepatitis A infection at the \ntime of vaccination. Additionally, vaccination with HAVRIX may not protect all individuals. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nThe safety of HAVRIX has been evaluated in 61 clinical trials involving approximately 37,000 \nindividuals receiving doses of 360 EL.U. (n = 21,928 in 3- or 4-dose schedule), 720 EL.U. \n(n = 12,274 in 2- or 3-dose schedule), or 1440 EL.U. (n = 2,782 in 2- or 3-dose schedule). \nOf solicited adverse reactions in clinical trials of adults, who received HAVRIX 1440 EL.U., and \nchildren (aged 2 years and older), who received either HAVRIX 360 EL.U. or 720 EL.U., the \nmost frequently reported was injection-site soreness (56% of adults and 21% of children); less \nthan 0.5% of soreness was reported as severe. Headache was reported by 14% of adults and less \nthan 9% of children. Other solicited and unsolicited reactions occurring during clinical trials are \nlisted below. \nIncidence 1% to 10% of Injections \nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Anorexia. \nGastrointestinal Disorders: Nausea. \n4 \nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Fatigue; fever >99.5°F (37.5°C); \ninduration, redness, and swelling of the injection site; malaise. \nIncidence <1% of Injections \nInfections and Infestations: Pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections. \nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Lymphadenopathy. \nPsychiatric Disorders: Insomnia. \nNervous System Disorders: Dysgeusia, hypertonia. \nEye Disorders: Photophobia. \nEar and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo. \nGastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting. \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Pruritus, rash, urticaria. \nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Arthralgia, myalgia. \nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Injection site hematoma. \nInvestigations: Creatine phosphokinase increased. \nCoadministration Studies of HAVRIX in Children Aged 11 to 25 Months \nIn 4 studies, 3,152 children aged 11 to 25 months received at least 1 dose of HAVRIX 720 EL.U. \nadministered alone or concomitantly with other routine childhood vaccinations [see Clinical \nStudies (14.2, 14.5)]. The studies included HAV 210 (N = 1,084), HAV 232 (N = 394), \nHAV 220 (N = 433), and HAV 231 (N = 1,241). \nIn the largest of these studies (HAV 231) conducted in the U.S., 1,241 children aged 15 months \nwere randomized to receive: Group 1) HAVRIX alone; Group 2) HAVRIX concomitantly with \nmeasles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine (manufactured by Merck and Co.) and varicella \nvaccine (manufactured by Merck and Co.); or Group 3) MMR and varicella vaccines. Subjects in \nGroup 3 who received MMR and varicella vaccines received the first dose of HAVRIX 42 days \nlater. A second dose of HAVRIX was administered to all subjects 6 to 9 months after the first \ndose of HAVRIX. Solicited local adverse reactions and general events were recorded by \nparents/guardians on diary cards for 4 days (Days 0 to 3) after vaccination. Unsolicited adverse \nevents were recorded on the diary card for 31 days after vaccination. Telephone follow-up was \nconducted 6 months after the last vaccination to inquire about serious adverse events, new onset \nchronic illnesses, and medically significant events. A total of 1,035 children completed the 6-\nmonth follow-up. Among subjects in all groups combined, 53% were male; 69% of subjects were \nWhite, 16% were Hispanic, 9% were Black, and 6% were other racial/ethnic groups. \nPercentages of subjects with solicited local adverse reactions and general adverse reactions \nfollowing HAVRIX administered alone (Group 1) or concomitantly with MMR and varicella \n5 \nvaccines (Group 2) are presented in Table 1. The solicited adverse reactions from the \n3 additional coadministration studies conducted with HAVRIX were comparable to those from \nStudy HAV 231. \nTable 1.

Among subjects administered HAVRIX alone 1.0% (13/1,332) \nreported a serious adverse event. Among subjects who received HAVRIX concomitantly with \nother childhood vaccines, 0.9% (8/909) reported a serious adverse event. In these 4 studies, there \nwere 4 reports of seizure within 31 days post-vaccination: these occurred 2, 9, and 27 days \nfollowing the first dose of HAVRIX administered alone and 12 days following the second dose \nof HAVRIX. In 1 subject who received INFANRIX (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and \nAcellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed) and Hib conjugate vaccine followed by HAVRIX 6 \nweeks later, bronchial hyperreactivity and respiratory distress were reported on the day of \nadministration of HAVRIX alone. \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of HAVRIX. \nBecause these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not \nalways possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the \nvaccine. \nInfections and Infestations \nRhinitis. \nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders \nThrombocytopenia. \nImmune System Disorders \nAnaphylactic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction, serum sickness–like syndrome. \nNervous System Disorders \nConvulsion, dizziness, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypoesthesia, multiple \nsclerosis, myelitis, neuropathy, paresthesia, somnolence, syncope. \nVascular Disorders \nVasculitis. \nRespiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \nDyspnea. \nHepatobiliary Disorders \nHepatitis, jaundice. \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \nAngioedema, erythema multiforme, hyperhidrosis. \n7 \nCongenital, Familial, and Genetic Disorders \nCongenital anomaly. \nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders \nMusculoskeletal stiffness. \nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \nChills, influenza-like symptoms, injection site reaction, local swelling. \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS \n7.1 \nConcomitant Administration with Vaccines and Immune Globulin \nIn clinical studies HAVRIX was administered concomitantly with the following vaccines [see \nAdverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.5)]. \n• INFANRIX (DTaP); \n• Hib conjugate vaccine; \n• pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine; \n• MMR vaccine; \n• varicella vaccine. \nHAVRIX may be administered concomitantly with immune globulin. \nWhen concomitant administration of other vaccines or immune globulin is required, they should \nbe given with different syringes and at different injection sites. Do not mix HAVRIX with any \nother vaccine or product in the same syringe. \n7.2 \nImmunosuppressive Therapies \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic \ndrugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater-than-physiologic doses), may reduce the immune \nresponse to HAVRIX. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n8.1 \nPregnancy \nRisk Summary \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general \npopulation, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically \nrecognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. \n8 \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of HAVRIX in pregnant women in the U.S. \nAvailable data do not suggest an increased risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in women \nwho received HAVRIX during pregnancy (see Data). \nThere are no animal studies with HAVRIX to inform use during pregnancy. \nData \nHuman Data: In pre- and post-licensure clinical studies of HAVRIX, 175 pregnant women (177 \noutcomes, including two sets of twins) were inadvertently administered HAVRIX following their \nlast menstrual period. After excluding ectopic pregnancies (n = 2), molar pregnancies (n = 1), \nelective terminations (n = 22, including one of a fetus with a birth defect), those that were lost to \nfollow-up (n = 9), and those with an unknown exposure timing (n = 5), there were 138 known \npregnancy outcomes with exposure during the first or second trimester. Of these, miscarriage \nwas reported in 11% of pregnancies exposed prior to 20 weeks gestation (15/136) and major \nbirth defects were reported in 3.3% (4/123) of live births. The rates of miscarriage and major \nbirth defects were consistent with estimated background rates. \n8.2 \nLactation \nRisk Summary \nThere is no information regarding the presence of HAVRIX in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of \nbreastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for HAVRIX and any \npotential adverse effects on the breastfed child from HAVRIX or from the underlying maternal \ncondition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease \nprevented by the vaccine. \n8.4 \nPediatric Use \nThe safety and effectiveness of HAVRIX, doses of 360 EL.U. or 720 EL.U., have been evaluated \nin more than 22,000 subjects aged 1 to 18 years. \nThe safety and effectiveness of HAVRIX have not been established in subjects younger than \n12 months. \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use \nClinical studies of HAVRIX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and \nolder to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported \nclinical experience has not identified differences in overall safety between these subjects and \nyounger adult subjects. \n8.6 \nHepatic Impairment \nSubjects with chronic liver disease had a lower antibody response to HAVRIX than healthy \nsubjects [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. \n9 \n11 \nDESCRIPTION \nHAVRIX (Hepatitis A Vaccine) is a sterile suspension of inactivated virus for intramuscular \nadministration. The virus (strain HM175) is propagated in MRC-5 human diploid cells. After \nremoval of the cell culture medium, the cells are lysed to form a suspension. This suspension is \npurified through ultrafiltration and gel permeation chromatography procedures. Treatment of this \nlysate with formalin ensures viral inactivation. Viral antigen activity is referenced to a standard \nusing an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and is therefore expressed in terms of \nELISA Units (EL.U.). \nEach 1-mL adult dose of vaccine contains 1440 EL.U. of viral antigen, adsorbed on 0.5 mg of \naluminum as aluminum hydroxide. \nEach 0.5-mL pediatric dose of vaccine contains 720 EL.U. of viral antigen, adsorbed onto \n0.25 mg of aluminum as aluminum hydroxide. \nHAVRIX contains the following excipients: Amino acid supplement (0.3% w/v) in a \nphosphate-buffered saline solution and polysorbate 20 (0.05 mg/mL). From the manufacturing \nprocess, HAVRIX also contains residual MRC-5 cellular proteins (not more than 5 mcg/mL), \nformalin (not more than 0.1 mg/mL), and neomycin sulfate (not more than 40 ng/mL), an \naminoglycoside antibiotic included in the cell growth media. \nHAVRIX is formulated without preservatives. \nHAVRIX is available in prefilled syringes. The tip cap and rubber plunger stopper of the \nprefilled syringe are not made with natural rubber latex. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action \nThe hepatitis A virus belongs to the picornavirus family. It is 1 of several hepatitis viruses that \ncause systemic disease with pathology in the liver. \nThe incubation period for hepatitis A averages 28 days (range: 15 to 50 days).1 The course of \nhepatitis A infection is extremely variable, ranging from asymptomatic infection to icteric \nhepatitis and death. \nThe presence of antibodies to HAV confers protection against hepatitis A infection. However, \nthe lowest titer needed to confer protection has not been determined. \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nHAVRIX has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential, or potential \nfor impairment of fertility. \n10 \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES \n14.1 \nPediatric Effectiveness Studies \nProtective efficacy with HAVRIX has been demonstrated in a double-blind, randomized \ncontrolled study in school children (aged 1 to 16 years) in Thailand who were at high risk of \nHAV infection. A total of 40,119 children were randomized to be vaccinated with either \nHAVRIX 360 EL.U. or ENGERIX-B [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)] 10 mcg at 0, 1, and \n12 months. Of these, 19,037 children received 2 doses of HAVRIX (0 and 1 months) and 19,120 \nchildren received 2 doses of control vaccine, ENGERIX-B (0 and 1 months). A total of 38,157 \nchildren entered surveillance at Day 138 and were observed for an additional 8 months. Using \nthe protocol-defined endpoint (2 days absence from school, ALT level >45 U/mL, and a \npositive result in the HAVAB-M test), 32 cases of clinical hepatitis A occurred in the control \ngroup. In the group receiving HAVRIX, 2 cases were identified. These 2 cases were mild in \nterms of both biochemical and clinical indices of hepatitis A disease. Thus the calculated \nefficacy rate for prevention of clinical hepatitis A was 94% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 74, \n98). \nIn outbreak investigations occurring in the trial, 26 clinical cases of hepatitis A (of a total of 34 \noccurring in the trial) occurred. No cases occurred in vaccinees who received HAVRIX. \nUsing additional virological and serological analyses post hoc, the efficacy of HAVRIX was \nconfirmed. Up to 3 additional cases of mild clinical illness may have occurred in vaccinees. \nUsing available testing, these illnesses could neither be proven nor disproven to have been \ncaused by HAV. By including these as cases, the calculated efficacy rate for prevention of \nclinical hepatitis A would be 84% (95% CI: 60, 94). \n14.2 \nImmunogenicity in Children and Adolescents \nImmune Response to HAVRIX 720 EL.U./0.5 mL at Age 11 to 25 Months (Study HAV 210) \nIn this prospective, open-label, multicenter study, 1,084 children were administered study \nvaccine in 1 of 5 groups: \n(1) Children aged 11 to 13 months who received HAVRIX on a 0- and 6-month schedule; \n(2) Children aged 15 to 18 months who received HAVRIX on a 0- and 6-month schedule; \n(3) Children aged 15 to 18 months who received HAVRIX coadministered with INFANRIX and \nHaemophilus b (Hib) conjugate vaccine (no longer U.S.-licensed) at Month 0 and HAVRIX at \nMonth 6; \n(4) Children aged 15 to 18 months who received INFANRIX coadministered with Hib conjugate \nvaccine at Month 0 and HAVRIX at Months 1 and 7; \n(5) Children aged 23 to 25 months who received HAVRIX on a 0- and 6-month schedule. \n11 \nAmong subjects in all groups, 52% were male; 61% of subjects were White, 9% were Black, 3% \nwere Asian, and 27% were other racial/ethnic groups. The anti-hepatitis A antibody vaccine \nresponses and geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs), calculated on responders for Groups 1, 2, \nand 5 are presented in Table 2. Vaccine response rates were similar among the 3 age-groups that \nreceived HAVRIX. One month after the second dose of HAVRIX, the GMT in each of the \nyounger age-groups (aged 11 to 13 months and 15 to 18 months) was shown to be similar to that \nachieved in the 23- to 25-month age-group. \nTable 2.

GMTs in children aged 11 to 13 months \nand 15 to 18 months were non-inferior (similar) to the GMT in children aged 23 to 25 months \n(i.e., the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI on the GMT ratio for Group 1/Group 5 and for \nGroup 2/Group 5 were both 0.5). \nIn 3 additional clinical studies (HAV 232, HAV 220, and HAV 231), children received either 2 \ndoses of HAVRIX alone or the first dose of HAVRIX concomitantly administered with other \nroutinely recommended U.S.-licensed vaccines followed by a second dose of HAVRIX. After \nthe second dose of HAVRIX, there was no evidence for interference with the anti-HAV response \nin the children who received concomitantly administered vaccines compared with those who \nreceived HAVRIX alone. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.5).] \nImmune Response to HAVRIX 360 EL.U. among Individuals Aged 2 to 18 Years \nIn 6 clinical studies, 762 subjects aged 2 to 18 years received 2 doses of HAVRIX (360 EL.U.) \ngiven 1 month apart (GMT ranged from 197 to 660 mIU/mL). Ninety-nine percent of subjects \nseroconverted following 2 doses. When a third dose of HAVRIX 360 EL.U. was administered \n6 months following the initial dose, all subjects were seropositive (anti-HAV 20 mIU/mL) \n1 month following the third dose, with GMTs rising to a range of 3,388 to 4,643 mIU/mL. In \n1 study in which children were followed for an additional 6 months, all subjects remained \nseropositive. \n12 \nImmune Response to HAVRIX 720 EL.U./0.5 mL among Individuals Aged 2 to 19 Years \nIn 4 clinical studies, 314 children and adolescents ranging from age 2 to 19 years were \nimmunized with 2 doses of HAVRIX 720 EL.U./0.5 mL given 6 months apart. One month after \nthe first dose, seroconversion (anti-HAV 20 mIU/mL [lower limit of antibody measurement by \nassay]) ranged from 96.8% to 100%, with GMTs of 194 mIU/mL to 305 mIU/mL. In studies in \nwhich sera were obtained 2 weeks following the initial dose, seroconversion ranged from 91.6% \nto 96.1%. One month following the booster dose at Month 6, all subjects were seropositive, with \nGMTs ranging from 2,495 mIU/mL to 3,644 mIU/mL. \nIn an additional study in which the booster dose was delayed until 1 year following the initial \ndose, 95.2% of the subjects were seropositive just prior to administration of the booster dose. \nOne month later, all subjects were seropositive, with a GMT of 2,657 mIU/mL. \n14.3 \nImmunogenicity in Adults \nMore than 400 healthy adults aged 18 to 50 years in 3 clinical studies were given a single \n1440 EL.U. dose of HAVRIX. All subjects were seronegative for hepatitis A antibodies at \nbaseline. Specific humoral antibodies against HAV were elicited in more than 96% of subjects \nwhen measured 1 month after vaccination. By Day 15, 80% to 98% of vaccinees had already \nseroconverted (anti-HAV 20 mIU/mL [lower limit of antibody measurement by assay]). GMTs \nof seroconverters ranged from 264 to 339 mIU/mL at Day 15 and increased to a range of 335 to \n637 mIU/mL by 1 month following vaccination. \nThe GMTs obtained following a single dose of HAVRIX are at least several times higher than \nthat expected following receipt of immune globulin. \nIn a clinical study using 2.5 to 5 times the standard dose of immune globulin (standard \ndose = 0.02 to 0.06 mL/kg), the GMT in recipients was 146 mIU/mL at 5 days \npost-administration, 77 mIU/mL at Month 1, and 63 mIU/mL at Month 2. \nIn 2 clinical trials in which a booster dose of 1440 EL.U. was given 6 months following the \ninitial dose, 100% of vaccinees (n = 269) were seropositive 1 month after the booster dose, with \nGMTs ranging from 3,318 mIU/mL to 5,925 mIU/mL. The titers obtained from this additional \ndose approximate those observed several years after natural infection. \nIn a subset of vaccinees (n = 89), a single dose of HAVRIX 1440 EL.U. elicited specific \nanti-HAV neutralizing antibodies in more than 94% of vaccinees when measured 1 month after \nvaccination. These neutralizing antibodies persisted until Month 6. One hundred percent of \nvaccinees had neutralizing antibodies when measured 1 month after a booster dose given at \nMonth 6. \nImmunogenicity of HAVRIX was studied in subjects with chronic liver disease of various \netiologies. One hundred eighty-nine healthy adults and 220 adults with either chronic hepatitis B \n(n = 46), chronic hepatitis C (n = 104), or moderate chronic liver disease of other etiology \n(n = 70) were vaccinated with HAVRIX 1440 EL.U. on a 0- and 6-month schedule. The last \n13 \ngroup consisted of alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 17), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 10), chronic \nhepatitis/cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 9), hemochromatosis (n = 2), primary biliary cirrhosis \n(n = 15), primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 4), and unspecified (n = 13). At each time point, \nGMTs were lower for subjects with chronic liver disease than for healthy subjects. At Month 7, \nthe GMTs ranged from 478 mIU/mL (chronic hepatitis C) to 1,245 mIU/mL (healthy). One \nmonth after the first dose, seroconversion rates in adults with chronic liver disease were lower \nthan in healthy adults. However, 1 month after the booster dose at Month 6, seroconversion rates \nwere similar in all groups; rates ranged from 94.7% to 98.1%. The relevance of these data to the \nduration of protection afforded by HAVRIX is unknown. \nIn subjects with chronic liver disease, local injection site reactions with HAVRIX were similar \namong all 4 groups, and no serious adverse reactions attributed to the vaccine were reported in \nsubjects with chronic liver disease. \n14.4 \nDuration of Immunity \nThe duration of immunity following a complete schedule of immunization with HAVRIX has \nnot been established. \n14.5 \nImmune Response to Concomitantly Administered Vaccines \nIn 3 clinical studies HAVRIX was administered concomitantly with other routinely \nrecommended U.S.-licensed vaccines: Study HAV 232: Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and \nacellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed (INFANRIX, DTaP) and Haemophilus b (Hib) conjugate \nvaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate) (manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur SA); Study HAV 220: \nPneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) (manufactured by Pfizer), and Study \nHAV 231: MMR and varicella vaccines. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] \nConcomitant Administration with DTaP and Hib Conjugate Vaccine (Study HAV 232) \nIn this U.S. multicenter study, 468 subjects, children aged 15 months were randomized to \nreceive: Group 1) HAVRIX coadministered with INFANRIX and Hib conjugate vaccine \n(n = 127); Group 2) INFANRIX and Hib conjugate vaccine alone followed by a first dose of \nHAVRIX 1 month later (n = 132); or Group 3) HAVRIX alone (n = 135). All subjects received a \nsecond dose of HAVRIX alone 6 to 9 months following the first dose. Among subjects in all \ngroups combined, 53% were male; 64% of subjects were White, 12% were Black, 6% were \nHispanic, and 18% were other racial/ethnic groups. \nThere was no evidence for reduced antibody response to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids \n(percentage of subjects with antibody levels 0.1 mIU/mL to each antigen), pertussis antigens \n(percentage of subjects with seroresponse, antibody concentrations 5 EL.U./mL in seronegative \nsubjects or post-vaccination antibody concentration 2 times the pre-vaccination antibody \nconcentration in seropositive subjects, and GMTs), or Hib (percentage of subjects with antibody \nlevels 1 mcg/mL to polyribosyl-ribitol phosphate, PRP) when HAVRIX was administered \n14 \nconcomitantly with INFANRIX and Hib conjugate vaccine (Group 1) relative to INFANRIX and \nHib conjugate vaccine administered together (Group 2). \nConcomitant Administration with Pneumococcal 7-Valent Conjugate Vaccine (Study HAV 220) \nIn this U.S. multicenter study, 433 children aged 15 months were randomized to receive: \nGroup 1) HAVRIX coadministered with PCV-7 vaccine (n = 137); Group 2) HAVRIX \nadministered alone (n = 147); or Group 3) PCV-7 vaccine administered alone (n = 149) followed \nby a first dose of HAVRIX 1 month later. All subjects received a second dose of HAVRIX 6 to \n9 months after the first dose. Among subjects in all groups combined, 53% were female; 61% of \nsubjects were White, 16% were Hispanic, 15% were Black, and 8% were other racial/ethnic \ngroups. \nThere was no evidence for reduced antibody response to PCV-7 (GMC to each serotype) when \nHAVRIX was administered concomitantly with PCV-7 vaccine (Group 1) relative to PCV-7 \nadministered alone (Group 3). \nConcomitant Administration with MMR and Varicella Vaccines (Study HAV 231) \nIn a U.S. multicenter study, there was no evidence for interference in the immune response to \nMMR and varicella vaccines (the percentage of subjects with pre-specified \nseroconversion/seroresponse levels) administered to subjects aged 15 months concomitantly with \nHAVRIX relative to the response when MMR and varicella vaccines are administered without \nHAVRIX.

After \nreconstitution, withdraw \n0.5 mL from the vial \ncontaining the \nreconstituted vaccine and \nadminister \nintramuscularly. \n \n3\n2.2 \nAdministration Instructions  \nFor intramuscular use. \nAfter reconstitution, administer SHINGRIX immediately or store refrigerated between 2° and 8°C (36° and \n46°F) and use within 6 hours. Discard reconstituted vaccine if not used within 6 hours. \nUse a separate sterile needle and sterile syringe for each individual. The preferred site for intramuscular \ninjection is the deltoid region of the upper arm. \n2.3 \nDose and Schedule  \nTwo doses (0.5 mL each) administered intramuscularly according to the following schedules: \n• A first dose at Month 0 followed by a second dose administered 2 to 6 months later. \n• For individuals who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed and who would benefit from a \nshorter vaccination schedule: A first dose at Month 0 followed by a second dose administered 1 to 2 months \nlater. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nFor injectable suspension. SHINGRIX is supplied as a single-dose vial of lyophilized gE antigen component to \nbe reconstituted with the accompanying vial of AS01B adjuvant suspension component. A single dose after \nreconstitution is 0.5 mL. \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \nDo not administer SHINGRIX to anyone with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any \ncomponent of the vaccine or after a previous dose of SHINGRIX [see Description (11)]. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nPreventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions  \nPrior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the immunization history for possible vaccine \nsensitivity and previous vaccination-related adverse reactions. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision \nmust be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of SHINGRIX. \n5.2 \nGuillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)  \nIn a postmarketing observational study, an increased risk of GBS was observed during the 42 days following \nvaccination with SHINGRIX [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. \n5.3 \nSyncope  \nSyncope (fainting) can be associated with the administration of injectable vaccines, including SHINGRIX. \nSyncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual disturbance, paresthesia, and \ntonic-clonic limb movements. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral \nperfusion following syncope. \n \n4\n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the \nclinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and \nmay not reflect the rates observed in practice. There is the possibility that broad use of SHINGRIX could reveal \nadverse reactions not observed in clinical trials. \nAdults Aged 50 Years and Older \nOverall, 17,041 adults aged 50 years and older received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX in 17 clinical studies. \nThe safety of SHINGRIX was evaluated by pooling data from 2 placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1 \nand 2) involving 29,305 subjects aged 50 years and older who received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX \n(n = 14,645) or saline placebo (n = 14,660) administered according to a 0- and 2-month schedule. At the time of \nvaccination, the mean age of the population was 69 years; 7,286 (25%) subjects were aged 50 through 59 years, \n4,488 (15%) subjects were aged 60 through 69 years, and 17,531 (60%) subjects were aged 70 years and older. \nBoth studies were conducted in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. In the overall \npopulation, the majority of subjects were White (74%), followed by Asian (18%), Black (1.4%), and other \nracial/ethnic groups (6%); 58% were female. \nSolicited Adverse Reactions: In Studies 1 and 2, data on solicited local and general adverse reactions were \ncollected using standardized diary cards for 7 days following each vaccine dose or placebo (i.e., day of \nvaccination and the next 6 days) in a subset of subjects (n = 4,886 receiving SHINGRIX, n = 4,881 receiving \nplacebo with at least 1 documented dose). Across both studies, the percentages of subjects aged 50 years and \nolder reporting each solicited local and general adverse reaction following administration of SHINGRIX (both \ndoses combined) were pain (78%), redness (38%), and swelling (26%); and myalgia (45%), fatigue (45%), \nheadache (38%), shivering (27%), fever (21%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (17%). \nThe reported frequencies of specific solicited local adverse reactions and general adverse reactions (overall per \nsubject), by age group, from the 2 studies are presented in Table 1. \n \n5\nTable 1.

Data for subjects \naged 70 years and older are based on pooled data from Study 1: NCT01165177 and Study 2: NCT01165229. \nc Placebo was a saline solution. \nd Grade 3 pain: Defined as significant pain at rest; prevents normal everyday activities. \ne Grade 3 myalgia, fatigue, headache, shivering, and GI: Defined as preventing normal activity. \nf Fever defined as ≥37.5°C/99.5°F for oral, axillary, or tympanic route, or ≥38°C/100.4°F for rectal route; \nGrade 3 fever defined as >39.0°C/102.2°F. \ng GI = Gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain. \nThe incidence of solicited local and general reactions was lower in subjects aged 70 years and older compared \nwith those aged 50 through 69 years. \nThe local and general adverse reactions seen with SHINGRIX had a median duration of 2 to 3 days. \n \n6\nThere were no differences in the proportions of subjects reporting any or Grade 3 solicited local reactions \nbetween Dose 1 and Dose 2. Headache and shivering were reported more frequently by subjects after Dose 2 \n(28% and 21%, respectively) compared with Dose 1 (24% and 14%, respectively). Grade 3 solicited general \nadverse reactions (headache, shivering, myalgia, and fatigue) were reported more frequently by subjects after \nDose 2 (2.3%, 3%, 4%, and 4%, respectively) compared with Dose 1 (1.4%, 1.4%, 2.3%, and 2.4%, \nrespectively). \nUnsolicited Adverse Events: Unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 30 days following each \nvaccination (Day 0 to 29) were recorded on a diary card by all subjects. In the 2 studies, unsolicited adverse \nevents occurring within 30 days of vaccination were reported in 51% and 32% of subjects who received \nSHINGRIX (n = 14,645) or placebo (n = 14,660), respectively (Total Vaccinated Cohort). Unsolicited adverse \nevents that occurred in ≥1% of recipients of SHINGRIX and at a rate at least 1.5-fold higher than placebo \nincluded chills (4% versus 0.2%), injection site pruritus (2.2% versus 0.2%), malaise (1.7% versus 0.3%), \narthralgia (1.7% versus 1.2%), nausea (1.4% versus 0.5%), and dizziness (1.2% versus 0.8%). \nGout (including gouty arthritis) was reported by 0.18% (n = 27) versus 0.05% (n = 8) of subjects who received \nSHINGRIX or placebo, respectively, within 30 days of vaccination; available information is insufficient to \ndetermine a causal relationship with SHINGRIX. \nSerious Adverse Events (SAEs): In the 2 studies, SAEs were reported at similar rates in subjects who received \nSHINGRIX (2.3%) or placebo (2.2%) from the first administered dose up to 30 days post-last vaccination. \nSAEs were reported for 10.1% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and for 10.4% of subjects who received \nplacebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination. One subject (<0.01%) reported \nlymphadenitis and 1 subject (<0.01%) reported fever greater than 39°C; there was a basis for a causal \nrelationship with SHINGRIX. \nOptic ischemic neuropathy was reported in 3 subjects (0.02%) who received SHINGRIX (all within 50 days \nafter vaccination) and 0 subjects who received placebo; available information is insufficient to determine a \ncausal relationship with SHINGRIX. \nDeaths: From the first administered dose up to 30 days post-last vaccination, deaths were reported for 0.04% of \nsubjects who received SHINGRIX and 0.05% of subjects who received placebo in the 2 studies. From the first \nadministered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination, deaths were reported for 0.8% of subjects who received \nSHINGRIX and for 0.9% of subjects who received placebo. Causes of death among subjects were consistent \nwith those generally reported in adult and elderly populations. \nPotential Immune-Mediated Diseases: In the 2 studies, new onset potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) \nor exacerbation of existing pIMDs were reported for 0.6% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and 0.7% of \nsubjects who received placebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination. The most \nfrequently reported pIMDs occurred with comparable frequencies in the group receiving SHINGRIX and the \nplacebo group. \nDosing Schedule: In an open-label clinical study, 238 subjects aged 50 years and older received SHINGRIX as \na 0- and 2-month or 0- and 6-month schedule. The safety profile of SHINGRIX was similar when administered \naccording to a 0- and 2-month or 0- and 6-month schedule and was consistent with that observed in Studies 1 \nand 2. \n \n7\nImmunocompromised Adults Aged 18 Years and Older \nThe safety of SHINGRIX was evaluated in 6 placebo-controlled clinical studies that enrolled 3,116 subjects \naged 18 years and older from 5 different immunodeficient or immunosuppressed (referred to as \nimmunocompromised) populations, in which a total of 1,587 received SHINGRIX. In all studies, subjects \nreceived Doses 1 and 2 of SHINGRIX 1 to 2 months apart. Safety monitoring for these studies was similar to \nStudies 1 and 2. In addition, subjects were monitored for events relevant to their specific disease or condition. \nAt the time of receipt of SHINGRIX or placebo, the mean age of the population was 55 years; 28% subjects \nwere aged 18 through 49 years and 72% subjects were aged 50 years and older. Each of the studies was \nconducted in one or more of the following regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and \nAustralia/New Zealand. The majority of subjects were White (77%), followed by Asian (17%), Black (2%), and \nother racial groups (3%); 4% were of American Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; 37% were female. \n \n8\nTable 2.

The local and \ngeneral adverse reactions seen with SHINGRIX had a median duration of 1 to 3 days across all studies enrolling \nimmunocompromised subjects. \nUnsolicited Adverse Events: Across all 6 studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects, unsolicited adverse \nevents, including both serious and non-serious events, occurring within 30 days following each vaccination \n \n11 \nwere reported in 46% and 44% of subjects who received SHINGRIX or placebo. Adverse events of arthralgia, \ninfective pneumonia, and influenza-like illness occurred in ≥1% of recipients of SHINGRIX and at a rate at \nleast 1.5-fold higher than placebo (1.5% versus 1.0%, 1.5% versus 0.9%, and 1.3% versus 0.6%, respectively). \nSerious Adverse Events: Across all 6 studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects, SAEs were reported at \nsimilar rates in subjects who received SHINGRIX (7%) or placebo (8%) from the first administered dose up to \n30 days post-last vaccination. SAEs were reported for 26% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and for 27% \nof subjects who received placebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination. SAEs of \ninfective pneumonia were reported for 21 subjects (1.3%) who received SHINGRIX and for 11 subjects (0.7%) \nwho received placebo up to 30 days post-last vaccination. Available information is insufficient to determine a \ncausal relationship to vaccination. \nDeaths: Across all 6 studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects, from the first administered dose up to \n30 days post-last vaccination, deaths were reported for 2 subjects (0.1%) who received SHINGRIX and 7 \nsubjects (0.5%) who received placebo. From the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination, \ndeaths were reported for 6% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and for 6% of subjects who received placebo. \nCauses of death among subjects were consistent with those expected in the populations evaluated. \nPotential Immune-Mediated Diseases: Across all 6 studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects, new onset \npIMDs or exacerbation of existing pIMDs were reported for 1.3% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and \n1.0% of subjects who received placebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination. There \nwere no notable imbalances in specific pIMDs between treatment groups. \nOther Medically Relevant Events: In the auHSCT study (NCT01610414), relapse or progression was reported \nby 315 of 922 subjects (34%) who received at least one dose of SHINGRIX and 331 of 924 subjects (36%) who \nreceived placebo from the first vaccination to study end. \nIn the auHSCT study (NCT00920218), relapse or progression was reported by 17 of 59 subjects (29%) who \nreceived at least one dose of SHINGRIX and 8 of 30 subjects (27%) who received placebo from the first \nvaccination to study end. \nIn the hematologic malignancy study, relapse or progression was reported by 45 of 283 subjects (16%) who \nreceived at least one dose of SHINGRIX and 58 of 279 subjects (21%) who received placebo from the first \nvaccination to study end. \nIn the renal transplant study, biopsy-confirmed allograft rejection was reported by 4 of 132 (3%) of subjects \nwho received SHINGRIX and by 7 of 132 (5%) of subjects who received placebo from the first vaccination to \nstudy end (approximately 13 months later). Creatinine as a measure of graft function and changes in \nalloimmunity post-vaccination were not systematically evaluated. \nIn the HIV study, at least 1 event of worsening HIV condition was reported by 9 of 74 (12%) of subjects who \nreceived SHINGRIX and by 5 of 49 (10%) of subjects who received placebo from the first vaccination to study \nend. \nConcomitant Administration with 23-Valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine \nIn an open-label clinical study (NCT02045836) in subjects aged 50 years and older, information about solicited \nlocal and systemic adverse reactions was collected using diary cards for 7 days (i.e., day of vaccination and the \nnext 6 days). When PNEUMOVAX 23 was concomitantly administered with the first dose of SHINGRIX \ncompared to when the first dose of SHINGRIX was given alone, a greater percentage of subjects reported fever, \n \n12 \ndefined as ≥37.5°C/99.5°F (16% vs. 7%, respectively) and shivering (21% vs. 7%, respectively) [see Clinical \nStudies (14.8)]. \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience  \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of SHINGRIX. Because these \nreactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably \nestimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the vaccine. \nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \nDecreased mobility of the injected arm which may persist for 1 or more weeks. \nImmune System Disorders \nHypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, rash, and urticaria. \nNervous System Disorders \nGuillain-Barré syndrome. \nPostmarketing Observational Study of the Risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome following Vaccination with \nSHINGRIX \nThe association between vaccination with SHINGRIX and GBS was evaluated among Medicare beneficiaries \naged 65 years or older. Using Medicare claims data, from October 2017 through February 2020, vaccinations \nwith SHINGRIX among beneficiaries were identified through National Drug Codes, and potential cases of \nhospitalized GBS among recipients of SHINGRIX were identified through International Classification of \nDiseases codes. \nThe risk of GBS following vaccination with SHINGRIX was assessed in self-controlled case series analyses \nusing a risk window of 1 to 42 days post-vaccination and a control window of 43 to 183 days post-vaccination. \nThe primary analysis (claims-based, all doses) found an increased risk of GBS during the 42 days following \nvaccination with SHINGRIX, with an estimated 3 excess cases of GBS per million doses administered to adults \naged 65 years or older. In secondary analyses, an increased risk of GBS was observed during the 42 days \nfollowing the first dose of SHINGRIX, with an estimated 6 excess cases of GBS per million doses administered \nto adults aged 65 years or older, and no increased risk of GBS was observed following the second dose of \nSHINGRIX. These analyses of GBS diagnoses in claims data were supported by analyses of GBS cases \nconfirmed by medical record review. While the results of this observational study suggest a causal association \nof GBS with SHINGRIX, available evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.1 Pregnancy  \nRisk Summary \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the \nestimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to \n4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The data are insufficient to establish if there is vaccine-associated risk with \nSHINGRIX in pregnant women. \n \n13 \nA developmental toxicity study was performed in female rats administered SHINGRIX or the AS01B adjuvant \nalone prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. The total dose was 0.2 mL on each occasion (a \nsingle human dose of SHINGRIX is 0.5 mL). This study revealed no adverse effects on fetal or pre-weaning \ndevelopment due to SHINGRIX (see Data). \nData \nAnimal Data: In a developmental toxicity study, female rats were administered SHINGRIX or the AS01B \nadjuvant alone by intramuscular injection 28 and 14 days prior to mating, on gestation Days 3, 8, 11, and 15, \nand on lactation Day 7. The total dose was 0.2 mL on each occasion (a single human dose of SHINGRIX is \n0.5 mL). No adverse effects on pre-weaning development up to post-natal Day 25 were observed. There were \nno vaccine-related fetal malformations or variations. \n8.2 \nLactation  \nRisk Summary \nIt is not known whether SHINGRIX is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects of \nSHINGRIX on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. \nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical \nneed for SHINGRIX and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from SHINGRIX or from the \nunderlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to \ndisease prevented by the vaccine. \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nSafety and effectiveness in individuals younger than 18 years have not been established. SHINGRIX is not \nindicated for prevention of primary varicella infection (chickenpox). \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use  \nAdults Aged 60 Years and Older \nOf the total number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX in Studies 1 and 2 (n = 14,645), \n2,243 (15%) were aged 60 through 69 years, 6,837 (47%) were aged 70 through 79 years, and 1,921 (13%) were \naged 80 years and older. There were no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy across the age groups. [See \nClinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.3).] \nThe frequencies of solicited local and general adverse reactions in subjects aged 70 years and older were lower \nthan in younger adults (aged 50 through 69 years). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] \nOf the total number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX in Studies 1 and 2 and were enrolled \ninto the long-term follow-up (LTFU) study (n = 7,408), 1,262 (17%) were aged 60 through 69 years, 3,428 \n(46%) were aged 70 through 79 years, and 642 (9%) were aged 80 years and older at the time of initial \nvaccination. From a median of 5.6 years after vaccination to a median of 11.4 years after vaccination, incidence \nrates of HZ were higher in older age groups (aged 70 through 79 and ≥80 years) compared with younger age \ngroups (aged 50 through 59 and 60 through 69 years). [See Clinical Studies (14.5).] \n \n14 \nImmunocompromised Adults Aged 65 Years and Older \nOf the total number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX in the auHSCT study (n = 922), 172 \n(18.7%) were aged 65 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. There were no clinically meaningful \ndifferences in efficacy between these subjects and younger adults (aged 18 through 64 years). \nOf the total number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX across the 6 studies in \nimmunocompromised subjects (n = 1,587), 337 (21.2%) were aged 65 years and older. The frequencies of \nsolicited local and general adverse reactions in subjects aged 65 years and older were generally similar to or \nlower than those reported by younger adults (aged 18 through 64 years). \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nSHINGRIX (Zoster Vaccine Recombinant, Adjuvanted) is a sterile injectable suspension for intramuscular use. \nThe vaccine is supplied as a vial of lyophilized recombinant varicella zoster virus surface glycoprotein E (gE) \nantigen component, which must be reconstituted at the time of use with the accompanying vial of AS01B \nadjuvant suspension component. The lyophilized gE antigen component is presented in the form of a sterile \nwhite powder. The AS01B adjuvant suspension component is an opalescent, colorless to pale brownish liquid \nsupplied in vials. \nThe gE antigen is obtained by culturing genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, which carry a \ntruncated gE gene, in media containing amino acids, with no albumin, antibiotics, or animal-derived proteins. \nThe gE protein is purified by several chromatographic steps, formulated with excipients, filled into vials, and \nlyophilized. \nThe adjuvant suspension component is AS01B which is composed of 3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid A \n(MPL) from Salmonella minnesota and QS-21, a saponin purified from plant extract Quillaja saponaria Molina, \ncombined in a liposomal formulation. The liposomes are composed of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) \nand cholesterol in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing disodium phosphate anhydrous, potassium \ndihydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, and water for injection. \nAfter reconstitution, each 0.5-mL dose is formulated to contain 50 mcg of the recombinant gE antigen, 50 mcg \nof MPL, and 50 mcg of QS-21. Each dose also contains 20 mg of sucrose (as stabilizer), 4.385 mg of sodium \nchloride, 1 mg of DOPC, 0.54 mg of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.25 mg of cholesterol, 0.160 mg of \nsodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, 0.15 mg of disodium phosphate anhydrous, 0.116 mg of dipotassium \nphosphate, and 0.08 mg of polysorbate 80. After reconstitution, SHINGRIX is a sterile, opalescent, colorless to \npale brownish liquid. \nSHINGRIX does not contain preservatives. Each dose may also contain residual amounts of host cell proteins \n(≤3.0%) and DNA (≤2.1 picograms) from the manufacturing process. \nThe vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action  \nThe risk of developing HZ, which increases with age and with immunosuppression due to disease and/or \ntherapy, appears to be related to a decline in varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific immunity. SHINGRIX was \n \n15 \nshown to boost VZV-specific immune response, which is thought to be the mechanism by which it protects \nagainst zoster disease [see Clinical Studies (14)]. \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nSHINGRIX has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Vaccination of female rats with \nSHINGRIX had no effect on fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. In a male fertility study, rats were \nvaccinated with 0.1 mL of SHINGRIX (a single human dose is 0.5 mL) on 42, 28, and 14 days prior to mating. \nThere were no effects on male fertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \n14.1 \nEfficacy in Subjects Aged 50 Years and Older  \nStudy 1 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical study conducted in 18 countries. \nRandomization was stratified (8:5:3:1) by age: 50 through 59 years, 60 through 69 years, 70 through 79 years, \nand ≥80 years. The study excluded, among others, subjects who were immunocompromised, had a history of \nprevious HZ, were vaccinated against varicella or HZ, and patients whose survival was not expected to be at \nleast 4 years or with conditions that might interfere with study evaluations. Subjects were followed for the \ndevelopment of HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) for a median of 3.1 years (range: 0 to 3.7 years). \nSuspected HZ cases were followed prospectively for the development of PHN, an HZ-related complication \ndefined as HZ-associated pain (rated as 3 or greater on a 0- to 10-point scale by the study subject) occurring or \npersisting at least 90 days following the onset of rash in confirmed cases of HZ. \nThe primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the modified Total Vaccinated Cohort [mTVC]) \nincluded 14,759 subjects aged 50 years and older who received 2 doses (0 and 2 months) of either SHINGRIX \n(n = 7,344) or placebo (n = 7,415) and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the second \ndose. In the mTVC population, 61% were female; 72% were White, 19% were Asian, 1.7% were Black, and 7% \nwere of other racial/ethnic groups. The mean age of subjects was 62.3 years. \nConfirmed HZ cases were determined by either Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (89.4%) or by a Clinical \nEvaluation Committee (10.6%). \nEfficacy against Herpes Zoster \nCompared with placebo, SHINGRIX significantly reduced the risk of developing HZ by 97.2% (95% CI: 93.7, \n99.0) in subjects aged 50 years and older (Table 4). \n \n16 \nTable 4.

With the exception of age, the \nstudy exclusion criteria were the same as for Study 1. Subjects were followed for the development of HZ and \nPHN for a median of 3.9 years (range: 0 to 4.5 years). Suspected HZ cases were followed prospectively for the \ndevelopment of PHN as for Study 1. \nThe primary efficacy analysis population (mTVC) included 13,163 subjects aged 70 years and older who \nreceived 2 doses (0 and 2 months) of either SHINGRIX (n = 6,541) or placebo (n = 6,622) and did not develop \na confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the second dose. In the mTVC population, 55% were female; 78% \nwere White, 17% were Asian, 1% were Black, and 4% were of other racial/ethnic groups. The mean age of \nsubjects was 75.5 years. \nConfirmed HZ cases were determined by either PCR (92.3%) or by a Clinical Evaluation Committee (7.7%). \nEfficacy against Herpes Zoster \nVaccine efficacy results against HZ in subjects aged 70 years and older are shown in Table 5. \n \n17 \nTable 5.

Vaccine efficacy against PHN was 85.5% \n(95% CI: [58.5; 96.3]). The benefit of SHINGRIX in the prevention of PHN can be attributed to the effect of \nthe vaccine on the prevention of HZ. \nReduction of Use of Pain Medication \nAmong subjects with confirmed HZ, the use of HZ-associated pain medications was reported for 10 of 23 \nsubjects (43.5%) who received SHINGRIX and for 160 of 223 subjects (71.7%) who received placebo. \n14.3 \nPooled Efficacy Analyses across Studies 1 and 2  \nThe efficacy of SHINGRIX to prevent HZ and PHN in subjects aged 70 years and older was evaluated by \ncombining the results from Studies 1 and 2 through a pre-specified pooled analysis in the mTVC. A total of \n8,250 and 8,346 subjects who received SHINGRIX and placebo, respectively, were included in the pooled \nmTVC analysis. \nEfficacy against Herpes Zoster \nCompared with placebo, SHINGRIX significantly reduced the risk of developing HZ by 91.3% (95% CI: 86.9, \n94.5) in subjects aged 70 years and older (Table 6). \n \n18 \nTable 6.

The efficacy of SHINGRIX in the prevention of PHN in subjects with confirmed HZ could \nnot be demonstrated. \n14.4 \nImmunological Evaluation to Support Dosing Schedule  \nA measure of the immune response that confers protection against HZ is unknown. Anti-gE antibody levels \nwere measured by anti-gE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gE ELISA) and were used to support the \ndosing schedule. \nIn an open-label clinical study, 238 subjects aged 50 years and older received SHINGRIX on either a 0- and \n2-month or 0- and 6-month schedule. Non-inferiority of the 0- and 6-month schedule compared with the 0- and \n2-month schedule based on anti-gE ELISA GMCs 1 month after the second dose was demonstrated. \n14.5 \nLong-Term Follow-Up Study  \nAn open-label, LTFU study (NCT02723773) was conducted in subjects aged 50 years and older who received \nSHINGRIX in Studies 1 and 2. \nThe primary analysis population (mTVC) included subjects who received 2 doses of SHINGRIX in Studies 1 \nand 2 and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the second dose. The mTVC included \n7,273 subjects who were followed for the occurrence of HZ and PHN starting at a median of 5.6 years \npost-vaccination in Studies 1 and 2 and ending at a median of 11.4 years post-vaccination. Of the 7,273 subjects \nin the mTVC, 2,046 were aged 50 through 59 years (28%), 1,243 (17%) were aged 60 through 69 years, 3,359 \n \n20 \n(46%) were aged 70 through 79 years, and 625 (9%) were aged 80 years or older at the time of initial \nvaccination. Demographic distribution of subjects (by sex, race, and ethnicity) was similar to Studies 1 and 2. \nOf the subjects in the mTVC, 15 subjects who developed HZ in Studies 1 and 2 were excluded from the HZ \nanalysis (n = 7,258 subjects). Among subjects 50 through 59 years, 60 through 69 years, 70 through 79 years, \nand 80 years or older at the time of vaccination, the incidence rates of HZ over the duration of the LTFU study \nwere 1.0, 1.3, 2.3, and 2.5 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. In the LTFU study, the incidence rates by age \ngroup were higher than the incidence rates of HZ reported by age group in the SHINGRIX groups in Study 1 \nand in the pooled analysis of Studies 1 and 2 (which were 0.3, 0.3, 0.8, and 1.0 per 1,000 person-years, \nrespectively [see Tables 4 and 6]). The incidence rates were lower than those reported by age group in the \nplacebo groups in Study 1 and in the pooled analysis of Studies 1 and 2 (which were 7.8, 10.8, 8.9 and 11.1 per \n1,000 person-years, respectively [see Tables 4 and 6]). In Studies 1 and 2, the median follow-up time after \nvaccination was 3.1 and 3.9 years, respectively. \nOf the subjects in the mTVC, 2 subjects who developed PHN in Studies 1 and 2 were excluded from the PHN \nanalysis (n = 7,271 subjects). Over the duration of the LTFU study, 4 cases of PHN were reported in the \nSHINGRIX group. One case was reported in a subject aged 67 years and 3 cases were reported in subjects 70 \nyears or older at the time of vaccination. The incidence rate of PHN among subjects 70 years or older was 0.1 \nper 1,000 person-years. This incidence rate is the same as the incidence rate of PHN reported in the SHINGRIX \ngroup and lower than the incidence rate reported in the placebo group in the pooled analysis of Studies 1 and 2 \n(which was 1.2 per 1,000 person-years [see Table 7]). The benefit of SHINGRIX in the prevention of PHN can \nbe attributed to the effect of the vaccine on the prevention of HZ. \n14.6 \nEfficacy in Immunocompromised Adults Aged 18 Years and Older  \nThe efficacy of SHINGRIX was evaluated in 1 Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical \nstudy in immunocompromised adults aged ≥18 years who received an auHSCT 50 to 70 days prior to Dose 1 \nand who were expected to receive prophylactic antiviral therapy for ≤6 months post-transplant. The efficacy of \nSHINGRIX was calculated post-hoc in another randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study in \nsubjects with hematologic malignancies who received Dose 1 of SHINGRIX or placebo during or within \n6 months of completing immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Each of these studies was conducted in the \nfollowing regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa (auHSCT study only), and \nAustralia/New Zealand. \nEfficacy in Subjects Aged 18 Years and Older: auHSCT Recipients \nIn the auHSCT study, subjects were followed for the development of HZ and PHN for a median of 21 months \n(range: 0 to 49.4 months). Suspected HZ cases were followed prospectively for the development of PHN as in \nStudies 1 and 2. \nThe primary efficacy analysis population (mTVC) for the auHSCT study included 1,721 subjects who received \n2 doses of either SHINGRIX or placebo and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the \nsecond dose. Confirmed HZ cases were determined by either PCR (83.7%) or by a Clinical Evaluation \nCommittee (16.3%). \nEfficacy against Herpes Zoster: Compared with placebo, SHINGRIX significantly reduced the risk of \ndeveloping HZ in auHSCT recipients aged 18 years and older (Table 8). \n \n21 \nTable 8.

Follow-up was censored at the time of treatment for relapse. \nb NCT01610414. \nc Primary study endpoint was based on confirmed HZ cases in subjects aged ≥18 years. \nEfficacy in Subjects Aged 18 Years and Older with Hematologic Malignancies \nIn the study of hematologic malignancies, the mean age was 57 years. The majority of subjects were White \n(71%), followed by Asian (25%), Black (0.4%), and other racial groups (4%); 5% were of American Hispanic \nor Latino ethnicity; and 41% were female. Subjects were followed for the development of HZ for a median of \n11.1 months (range: 0 to 15.6 months). PHN was not assessed as a study endpoint. \nIn the hematologic malignancy study, the population for the post hoc efficacy analysis included 515 subjects \nwho received 2 doses of either SHINGRIX or placebo and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within \n1 month after the second dose. Confirmed HZ cases were determined by either PCR (81.3%) or by a Clinical \nEvaluation Committee (18.7%). The post hoc analysis showed SHINGRIX was 87.2% (95% CI [44.2; 98.6]) \neffective against development of HZ. The incidence rate of HZ per 1,000 person-years was 8.5 versus 66.2 in \nthe SHINGRIX and placebo groups, respectively. \nAdditional Efficacy Endpoints Evaluated in the auHSCT Study \nEfficacy against Postherpetic Neuralgia: In a descriptive analysis, including all subjects aged ≥18 years in the \nmTVC, 1 case of PHN was reported in the vaccine group compared with 9 cases reported in the placebo group. \nVaccine efficacy against PHN was 89.3% (95% CI: [22.5; 99.8]). The benefit of SHINGRIX in the prevention \nof PHN can be attributed to the effect of the vaccine on the prevention of HZ. \nHerpes Zoster-Associated Pain: Subjects with suspected HZ rated their “worst” HZ-associated pain on a \n10-point scale. Among subjects with confirmed HZ, 37 out of 49 subjects (75.5%) receiving SHINGRIX and \n120 out of 135 subjects (88.9%) receiving placebo rated their “worst” HZ-associated pain as 3 or greater. In this \n \n22 \nsubset of subjects, the median duration of “worst” HZ associated pain was 14 and 24 days, among SHINGRIX \nand placebo recipients, respectively. \n14.7 \nRevaccination after Vaccination with ZOSTAVAX (Zoster Vaccine Live)  \nIn an open-label clinical study (NCT02581410), subjects aged 65 years and older, who had been previously \nvaccinated with ZOSTAVAX more than 5 years prior to study enrollment (n = 215) or who had never been \nvaccinated with ZOSTAVAX (n = 215), received 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Months 0 and 2. Subjects who had \nnever been vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX were matched to those who had been previously vaccinated with \nZOSTAVAX according to the predefined variables of age (65 through 69, 70 through 79, and ≥80 years), sex, \nrace/ethnicity, and medical condition (immune-mediated diseases, diabetes mellitus, depression, pulmonary \nconditions, or heart conditions). The mean age was 71 years; 51% were female. All subjects were White and \nwere not Hispanic or Latino. \nThe anti-gE antibody (Ab) concentration measured by ELISA 1 month following 2 doses of SHINGRIX in \nsubjects who had previously been vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX was non-inferior to that of subjects who had \nnever been vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX. The upper limit (UL) of the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.17 \n(success criterion <1.5) for the anti-gE Ab adjusted geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio between \nsubjects who had never been vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX and subjects who had been previously vaccinated \nwith ZOSTAVAX. There was no evidence for interference in the immune response to SHINGRIX in subjects \npreviously vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX. \n14.8 \nConcomitant Administration with Other Vaccines  \nConcomitant Administration with Influenza Vaccine \nIn an open-label clinical study (NCT01954251), subjects aged 50 years and older received 1 dose each of \nSHINGRIX and quadrivalent influenza vaccine (FLUARIX QUADRIVALENT) at Month 0 and 1 dose of \nSHINGRIX at Month 2 (n = 413), or 1 dose of FLUARIX QUADRIVALENT at Month 0 and 1 dose of \nSHINGRIX at Months 2 and 4 (n = 415). The mean age of the population was 63 years; 52% were female. The \nmajority of subjects were White (92%), followed by Asian (6%), and Black (2%); 0.4% were of American \nHispanic or Latino ethnicity. There was no evidence for interference in the immune response to any of the \nantigens contained in SHINGRIX or the coadministered vaccine. \nConcomitant Administration with PNEUMOVAX 23 (Pneumococcal Vaccine Polyvalent) \nIn an open-label clinical study (NCT02045836), subjects aged 50 years and older received 1 dose each of \nSHINGRIX and PNEUMOVAX 23 at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Month 2 (n = 432), or 1 dose of \nPNEUMOVAX 23 at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Months 2 and 4 (n = 433). The mean age of the \npopulation was 63 years; 60% were female. The majority of subjects were White (94%), followed by Black \n(2%), Asian (2%), and other racial groups (2%); 1% were of American Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. \nThe immune response to SHINGRIX, based on anti-gE Ab, was measured by ELISA 1 month after \nadministration of the second dose of SHINGRIX. Immune responses to 12 of the 23 pneumococcal serotypes \ncontained in PNEUMOVAX 23 were measured by multiplex opsonophagocytosis assay (MOPA) at 1 month \nafter administration of the single dose of PNEUMOVAX 23. There was no evidence for interference in the \nimmune response to the antigen contained in SHINGRIX or to the 12 evaluated antigens contained in \nPNEUMOVAX 23 when the two vaccines were administered concomitantly. \n \n23 \nConcomitant Administration with PREVNAR 13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria \nCRM197 Protein]) \nIn an open-label clinical study (NCT03439657), subjects aged 50 years and older received 1 dose each of \nSHINGRIX and PREVNAR 13 at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Month 2 (n = 449), or 1 dose of \nPREVNAR 13 at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Months 2 and 4 (n = 463). The mean age of the \npopulation was 63 years; 60% were female. The majority of subjects were White (98%), followed by Black \n(2%); 0.4% were of American Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. \nThe immune response to SHINGRIX, based on anti-gE Ab, was measured by ELISA 1 month after \nadministration of the second dose of SHINGRIX. Immune responses to the pneumococcal serotypes contained \nin PREVNAR 13 were measured by MOPA at 1 month after administration of the single dose of \nPREVNAR 13. There was no evidence for interference in the immune response to the antigens contained in \nSHINGRIX or PREVNAR 13 when the two vaccines were administered concomitantly. \nConcomitant Administration with BOOSTRIX (Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular \nPertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed) \nIn an open-label clinical study (NCT02052596), subjects aged 50 years and older received 1 dose each of \nSHINGRIX and BOOSTRIX at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Month 2 (n = 412; concomitant \nadministration group), or 1 dose of BOOSTRIX at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Months 2 and 4 \n(n = 418; sequential administration group). The mean age of the population was 63 years; 54% were female. \nThe majority of subjects were White (87%), followed by Black (11%), and other racial groups; 2% were of \nAmerican Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. \nThe immune response to SHINGRIX, based on anti-gE Ab, was measured by ELISA 1 month after \nadministration of the second dose of SHINGRIX. The immune response to BOOSTRIX (anti-D, anti-T, and \nantibodies to pertussis antigens) was measured 1 month after administration of the single dose of BOOSTRIX. \nConcomitant administration showed no evidence for interference in the immune response to the antigen \ncontained in SHINGRIX or the antigens contained in BOOSTRIX, with the exception of one of the pertussis \nantigens (pertactin), which did not meet the non-inferiority criterion: the UL of the 95% CI for the adjusted \nGMC ratio (sequential administration group/concomitant administration group) for anti-pertactin antibody was \n1.58 (non-inferiority criterion <1.5). The clinical significance of the reduced immune response to pertactin is \nunknown. \n16 \nHOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING  \nSHINGRIX is supplied as 2 components: A single-dose vial of lyophilized gE antigen component (powder) and \na single-dose vial of adjuvant suspension component (liquid) (packaged without syringes or needles). \n \n24 \nTable 9.

The contents of the vial must be reconstituted with the diluent to form ROTARIX prior \nto administration. \nOral Dosing Applicator Only Presentation \nThe oral dosing applicator only presentation contains ROTARIX and does NOT require \nreconstitution or dilution before use. \n2.2 \nPreparation and Administration  \nVial and Oral Dosing Applicator Presentation \nUse accompanying diluent to reconstitute the lyophilized vaccine component to form ROTARIX. \nAfter reconstitution, each dose of 1 mL is administered orally. \nSee Figure 1 for preparation and administration steps. \nFigure 1. Preparation and Administration steps of Vial and Oral Dosing Applicator \nPresentation \n \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nFor oral administration only. Have the infant \nseated in a reclining position. Place the oral \ndosing applicator towards the inner cheek. \nAdminister the entire contents of the oral dosing \napplicator into the infant’s mouth. \n \n \nOral Dosing Applicator Only Presentation \nThe ROTARIX oral dosing applicator only presentation does NOT require reconstitution or \ndilution before use. Each dose of 1.5 mL is administered orally.  \nSee Figure 2 for preparation and administration steps. \nFigure 2. Preparation and Administration Steps of Oral Dosing Applicator Only \nPresentation \n \n5 \n \n \n \nFor oral administration only. Have the infant \nseated in a reclining position. Place the oral \ndosing applicator towards the inner cheek. \nAdminister the entire contents of the oral \ndosing applicator into the infant’s mouth. \n \n \n \n \n2.3 \nDosing and Schedule  \nThe vaccination series consists of two doses administered orally. The first dose should be \nadministered to infants beginning at 6 weeks of age. There should be an interval of at least 4 \nweeks between the first and second dose. The 2-dose series should be completed by 24 weeks of \nage. \nSafety and effectiveness have not been evaluated if ROTARIX were administered for the first \ndose and another rotavirus vaccine were administered for the second dose or vice versa. \nIn the event that the infant spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single \nreplacement dose may be considered at the same vaccination visit. \n2.4 \nInfant Feeding  \nBreastfeeding was permitted in clinical studies. There was no evidence to suggest that \nbreastfeeding reduced the protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis afforded by ROTARIX. \nThere are no restrictions on the infant’s liquid consumption, including breast milk, either before \nor after vaccination with ROTARIX. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nSuspension for oral use \n• Vial and oral dosing applicator presentation: after reconstitution a single dose is 1 mL. \n• Oral dosing applicator only presentation: a single dose is 1.5 mL. \n6 \n \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity  \nA demonstrated history of hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine. \nInfants who develop symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity after receiving a dose of \nROTARIX should not receive further doses of ROTARIX. \n4.2 \nGastrointestinal Tract Congenital Malformation  \nInfants with a history of uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract (such \nas Meckel’s diverticulum) that would predispose the infant for intussusception should not receive \nROTARIX. \n4.3 \nHistory of Intussusception  \nInfants with a history of intussusception should not receive ROTARIX [see Warnings and \nPrecautions (5.5)]. In postmarketing experience, intussusception resulting in death following a \nsecond dose has been reported following a history of intussusception after the first dose [see \nAdverse Reactions (6.2)]. \n4.4 \nSevere Combined Immunodeficiency Disease  \nInfants with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID) should not receive \nROTARIX. Postmarketing reports of gastroenteritis, including severe diarrhea and prolonged \nshedding of vaccine virus, have been reported in infants who were administered live, oral \nrotavirus vaccines and later identified as having SCID [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nLatex  \nThe tip caps of the prefilled oral dosing applicators contain natural rubber latex which may cause \nallergic reactions. \n5.2 \nGastrointestinal Disorders  \nAdministration of ROTARIX should be delayed in infants suffering from acute diarrhea or \nvomiting. \nSafety and effectiveness of ROTARIX in infants with chronic gastrointestinal disorders have not \nbeen evaluated. [See Contraindications (4.2).] \n5.3 \nAltered Immunocompetence  \nSafety and effectiveness of ROTARIX in infants with known primary or secondary \nimmunodeficiencies, including infants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), infants on \nimmunosuppressive therapy, or infants with malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or \nlymphatic system have not been established. \n7 \n \n5.4 \nShedding and Transmission  \nRotavirus shedding in stool occurs after vaccination with peak excretion occurring around Day 7 \nafter Dose 1. \nOne clinical trial demonstrated that vaccinees transmit vaccine virus to healthy seronegative \ncontacts [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. \nThe potential for transmission of vaccine virus following vaccination should be weighed against \nthe possibility of acquiring and transmitting natural rotavirus. Caution is advised when \nconsidering whether to administer ROTARIX to individuals with immunodeficient close \ncontacts, such as individuals with malignancies, primary immunodeficiency or receiving \nimmunosuppressive therapy. \n5.5 \nIntussusception  \nFollowing administration of a previously licensed oral live rhesus rotavirus-based vaccine, an \nincreased risk of intussusception was observed.1 The risk of intussusception with ROTARIX was \nevaluated in a pre-licensure randomized, placebo-controlled safety study (including 63,225 \ninfants) conducted in Latin America and Finland. No increased risk of intussusception was \nobserved in this clinical trial following administration of ROTARIX when compared with \nplacebo. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] \nIn a postmarketing, observational study conducted in Mexico, cases of intussusception were \nobserved in temporal association within 31 days following the first dose of ROTARIX, with a \nclustering of cases in the first 7 days. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2).] \nOther postmarketing observational studies conducted in Brazil and Australia also suggest an \nincreased risk of intussusception within the first 7 days following the second dose of \nROTARIX.2,3 [See Adverse Reactions (6.2).] \nIn worldwide passive postmarketing surveillance, cases of intussusception have been reported in \ntemporal association with ROTARIX [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. \n5.6 \nPost-Exposure Prophylaxis  \nSafety and effectiveness of ROTARIX when administered after exposure to rotavirus have not \nbeen evaluated. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \n8 \n \nThere are two formulations of ROTARIX: a reconstituted lyophilized formulation (supplied in a \nvial and oral dosing applicator presentation) and a liquid formulation (supplied in an oral dosing \napplicator only presentation) [see Description (11)]. Safety data accrued with each formulation \nis relevant to the other because each contains the same live, attenuated rotavirus strain and is \nmanufactured using a similar process. \nCommon (≥5%) solicited adverse reactions included fussiness/irritability, cough/runny nose, \nfever, loss of appetite, and vomiting. \nSolicited adverse reactions, unsolicited adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs), and cases \nof intussusception were collected in 7 clinical studies (Studies 1 to 7; NCT00729001, \nNCT00385320, NCT00429481, NCT00757770, NCT00140686, NCT00169455, \nNCT00137930). Cases of intussusception and SAEs were collected in an additional large safety \nstudy (Study 8; NCT00140673) that compared ROTARIX (reconstituted lyophilized \nformulation) to placebo. Solicited adverse reactions, unsolicited adverse events, and SAEs were \ncollected in 3 clinical studies (Studies 9 to 11; NCT02914184, NCT03207750, NCT03954743) \nthat compared the two ROTARIX formulations. \nClinical Trials Experience with ROTARIX (Reconstituted Lyophilized Formulation) \nStudies 1 to 8 evaluated a total of 71,209 infants who received ROTARIX (n = 36,755) or \nplacebo (n = 34,454). The racial distribution for these studies was as follows: Hispanic 73.4%, \nWhite 16.2%, Black 1.0%, and other 9.4%; 51% were male. \nSolicited Adverse Reactions: In 7 clinical studies (Studies 1 to 7), detailed safety information \nwas collected by parents/guardians for 8 consecutive days following vaccination with ROTARIX \n(i.e., day of vaccination and the next 7 days). A diary card was completed to record \nfussiness/irritability, cough/runny nose, the infant’s temperature, loss of appetite, vomiting, or \ndiarrhea on a daily basis during the first week following each dose of ROTARIX or placebo. \nAdverse reactions among recipients of ROTARIX and placebo occurred at similar rates \n(Table 1). \n9 \n \nTable 1.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in \n1.7% of recipients of ROTARIX (n = 36,755) as compared with 1.9% of placebo recipients \n(n = 34,454). Among placebo recipients, diarrhea (placebo 0.07%, ROTARIX 0.02%), \ndehydration (placebo 0.06%, ROTARIX 0.02%), and gastroenteritis (placebo 0.3%, ROTARIX \n0.2%) occurred at a statistically higher incidence (95% CI of RR excluding 1) as compared with \nrecipients of ROTARIX. \nDeaths: During the entire course of 8 clinical studies (Studies 1 to 8), there were 68 (0.19%) \ndeaths following administration of ROTARIX (n = 36,755) and 50 (0.15%) deaths following \nplacebo administration (n = 34,454). The most commonly reported cause of death following \nvaccination was pneumonia, which was observed in 19 (0.05%) recipients of ROTARIX and 10 \n(0.03%) placebo recipients (RR: 1.74, 95% CI: 0.76, 4.23). \n10 \n \nIntussusception: In a controlled safety study (Study 8) conducted in Latin America and Finland, \nthe risk of intussusception was evaluated in 63,225 infants (31,673 received ROTARIX and \n31,552 received placebo). Infants were monitored by active surveillance including independent, \ncomplementary methods (prospective hospital surveillance and parent reporting at scheduled \nstudy visits) to identify potential cases of intussusception within 31 days after vaccination and, in \na subset of 20,169 infants (10,159 received ROTARIX and 10,010 received placebo), up to one \nyear after the first dose. \nNo increased risk of intussusception following administration of ROTARIX was observed within \na 31-day period following any dose, and rates were comparable to the placebo group after a \nmedian of 100 days (Table 2). In a subset of 20,169 infants (10,159 received ROTARIX and \n10,010 received placebo) followed up to one year after Dose 1, there were 4 cases of \nintussusception with ROTARIX compared with 14 cases of intussusception with placebo (RR: \n0.28 [95% CI: 0.10, 0.81]). All of the infants who developed intussusception recovered without \nsequelae. \nTable 2.

Of the 27 cases, 5 occurred \nfollowing ROTARIX in clinical trials that were either not placebo-controlled or 1:1 randomized. \nIn placebo-controlled trials, Kawasaki disease was reported in 17 recipients of ROTARIX and 9 \nplacebo recipients (RR: 1.71 [95% CI: 0.71, 4.38]). Three of the 27 cases were reported within \n30 days post-vaccination: 2 cases (ROTARIX = 1, placebo = 1) were from placebo-controlled \ntrials (RR: 1.00 [95% CI: 0.01, 78.35]) and one case following ROTARIX was from a non–\nplacebo-controlled trial. Among recipients of ROTARIX, the time of onset after study dose \nranged 3 days to 19 months. \nClinical Trials Comparing the Two ROTARIX Formulations \nThe safety of the ROTARIX liquid formulation was evaluated in 3 randomized clinical studies \n(Studies 9 to 11). A total of 4,223 infants received ROTARIX (liquid formulation, n = 2,507; \nreconstituted lyophilized formulation, n = 1,716). The racial distribution for these 3 studies was \nas follows: Asian 24.4%, White 63.2%, Black or African American 5.1%, and other 7.3%; 49.7% \nwere male. \nIn Study 10, a concomitant vaccine administration study conducted in United States, 1,272 \ninfants received ROTARIX (liquid formulation, n = 632; reconstituted lyophilized formulation, \nn = 640). The racial distribution for this study was as follows: Asian 3.3%, White 73.8%, Black \nor African American 11.9%, and other 10.9%; 51.5% were male. \nIn Studies 9 to 11, solicited general adverse reactions (cough/runny nose, diarrhea, fever, \nirritability/fussiness, loss of appetite and vomiting) were recorded by the parent on diary cards \nduring the 8 days after each vaccination (day of vaccination and 7 following days). Unsolicited \nadverse events were assessed within 31 days following each vaccination (day of vaccination and \n30 following days). SAEs were assessed through 6 months after the last dose. \nSolicited Adverse Reactions: In Study 10, solicited adverse reactions among recipients of the two \nROTARIX formulations are presented in the Table 4: \n12 \n \nTable 4.

There were no notable \ndifferences in the occurrence and frequency of unsolicited adverse events between the groups.  \nSerious Adverse Events: During the entire course of Studies 9 to 11, SAEs occurred in 4.7% of \nrecipients of ROTARIX liquid formulation (n = 2,507) as compared with 4.4% of ROTARIX \nreconstituted lyophilized formulation recipients (n = 1,716). \n13 \n \nDuring the entire course of Studies 9 to 11, there was 1 fatal SAE (with diagnosis of sudden \ninfant death syndrome) following administration of ROTARIX liquid formulation (Study 10). \nThe SAE was assessed as not causally related to the vaccination. \nAmong participants in Studies 9 to 11, 2 intussusception cases were reported. One subject from \nStudy 10 experienced intussusception 8 days after receiving the second dose of ROTARIX \n(reconstituted lyophilized formulation). The event was considered possibly related to ROTARIX. \nOne subject from Study 9 experienced intussusception 133 days after receiving the second dose \nof ROTARIX (liquid formulation); the event was not considered related to ROTARIX. Both \nsubjects were hospitalized, and the outcome of intussusception was reported as resolved. \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience  \nThe temporal association between vaccination with ROTARIX and intussusception was \nevaluated in a hospital-based active surveillance study that identified infants with intussusception \nat participating hospitals in Mexico. Using a self-controlled case series method,4 the incidence of \nintussusception during the first 7 days after receipt of ROTARIX and during the 31-day period \nafter receipt of ROTARIX was compared with a control period. The control period was from \nbirth to one year, excluding the pre-defined risk period (first 7 days or first 31 days post-\nvaccination, respectively). \nOver a 2-year period, the participating hospitals provided health services to approximately \n1 million infants under 1 year of age. Among 750 infants with intussusception, the relative \nincidence of intussusception in the 31-day period after the first dose of ROTARIX compared \nwith the control period was 1.96 (95.5% CI: 1.46, 2.63)]; the relative incidence of \nintussusception in the first 7 days after the first dose of ROTARIX compared with the control \nperiod was 6.07 (95.5% CI: 4.20, 8.63). \nThe Mexico study did not take into account all medical conditions that may predispose infants to \nintussusception. The results may not be generalizable to U.S. infants who have a lower \nbackground rate of intussusception than Mexican infants. However, if a temporal increase in the \nrisk for intussusception following ROTARIX similar in magnitude to that observed in the \nMexico study does exist in U.S. infants, it is estimated that approximately 1 to 3 additional cases \nof intussusception hospitalizations would occur per 100,000 vaccinated infants in the U.S. within \n7 days following the first dose of ROTARIX. In the first year of life, the background rate of \nintussusception hospitalizations in the U.S. has been estimated to be approximately 34 per \n100,000 infants.5 \nOther postmarketing observational studies conducted in Brazil and Australia also suggest an \nincreased risk of intussusception within the first 7 days following the second dose of \nROTARIX.2,3 \nWorldwide passive postmarketing surveillance data suggest that most cases of intussusception \nreported following ROTARIX occur in the 7-day period after the first dose. \n14 \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ROTARIX. \nBecause these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not \nalways possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to \nvaccination. \nGastrointestinal Disorders \nIntussusception (including death), recurrent intussusception (including death), hematochezia, \ngastroenteritis with vaccine viral shedding in infants with SCID. \nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders \nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. \nVascular Disorders \nKawasaki disease. \nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions  \nMaladministration.  \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 \nImmunosuppressive Therapies  \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic \ndrugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune \nresponse to ROTARIX. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3).] \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nSafety and effectiveness of ROTARIX in infants younger than 6 weeks or older than 24 weeks of \nage have not been evaluated. \nThe effectiveness of ROTARIX in pre-term infants has not been established. Safety data are \navailable in pre-term infants (ROTARIX = 134, placebo = 120) with a reported gestational age \n36 weeks. These pre-term infants were followed for SAEs up to 30 to 90 days after Dose 2. \nSAEs were observed in 5.2% of recipients of ROTARIX as compared with 5.0% of placebo \nrecipients. No deaths or cases of intussusception were reported in this population. \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nROTARIX (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral), for oral administration, is a live, attenuated rotavirus \nvaccine derived from the human 89-12 strain which belongs to G1P[8] type. The rotavirus \nvaccine strain is propagated on Vero cells. \n15 \n \nThere are two formulations of ROTARIX: a reconstituted lyophilized formulation (supplied in a \nvial and oral dosing applicator presentation) and a liquid formulation (supplied in an oral dosing \napplicator only presentation). \nFormulation for the Vial and Oral Dosing Applicator Presentation \nAfter reconstitution of the lyophilized vaccine component, each 1 mL dose of the ROTARIX \nformulation for the vial and oral dosing applicator presentation contains at least 106.0 median Cell \nCulture Infective Dose (CCID50) of live, attenuated rotavirus.  \nThe lyophilized vaccine component of this ROTARIX formulation contains amino acids, \ndextran, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), sorbitol, and sucrose. DMEM contains \nthe following ingredients: sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, ferric (III) \nnitrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium pyruvate, D-glucose, concentrated vitamin \nsolution, L-cystine, L-tyrosine, amino acids solution, L-glutamine, calcium chloride, and sodium \nhydrogenocarbonate. \nIn the manufacturing process, porcine-derived materials are used. Porcine circovirus type 1 \n(PCV-1) is present in this ROTARIX formulation. PCV-1 is not known to cause disease in \nhumans. \nThe liquid diluent contains calcium carbonate, sterile water, and xanthan. The diluent includes an \nantacid component (calcium carbonate) to protect the vaccine during passage through the \nstomach and prevent its inactivation due to the acidic environment of the stomach. \nThis ROTARIX formulation is available in single-dose vials of lyophilized vaccine, \naccompanied by a prefilled oral dosing applicator of liquid diluent [see How Supplied/Storage \nand Handling (16)]. The tip caps of the prefilled oral dosing applicators contain natural rubber \nlatex; the vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. \nThis ROTARIX formulation contains no preservatives. \nFormulation for the Oral Dosing Applicator Only Presentation \nEach 1.5 mL dose of the ROTARIX formulation for the oral dosing applicator only presentation \ncontains at least 106.0 CCID50 of live, attenuated rotavirus. \nThis ROTARIX formulation contains disodium adipate, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium \n(DMEM), sucrose, and sterile water. DMEM contains the following ingredients: sodium \nchloride, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, ferric (III) nitrate, sodium dihydrogen \nphosphate, sodium pyruvate, D-glucose, concentrated vitamin solution, L-cystine, L-tyrosine, \namino acids solution, L-glutamine, calcium chloride, and sodium hydrogenocarbonate. \nThis ROTARIX formulation contains an antacid component (disodium adipate) to protect the \nvaccine during passage through the stomach and prevent its inactivation due to the acidic \nenvironment of the stomach. \n16 \n \nThis ROTARIX formulation is available in single-dose prefilled oral dosing applicator [see How \nSupplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. The tip caps of the prefilled oral dosing applicators \ncontain natural rubber latex. \nThis ROTARIX formulation contains no preservatives. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action  \nThe exact immunologic mechanism by which ROTARIX protects against rotavirus \ngastroenteritis is unknown [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. ROTARIX contains a live, attenuated \nhuman rotavirus that replicates in the small intestine and induces immunity. \n12.2 \nPharmacodynamics  \nShedding and Transmission \nA prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in the \nDominican Republic in twins within the same household to assess whether transmission of \nvaccine virus occurs from a vaccinated infant to a non-vaccinated infant (Study 20; \nNCT00396630). One hundred pairs of healthy twins 6 to 14 weeks of age (gestational age \n32 weeks) were randomized with one twin to receive ROTARIX (n = 100) and the other twin to \nreceive placebo (n = 100). Twenty subjects in each arm were excluded for reasons such as \nhaving rotavirus antibody at baseline. Stool samples were collected on the day of or 1 day prior \nto each dose, as well as 3 times weekly for 6 consecutive weeks after each dose of ROTARIX or \nplacebo. Transmission was defined as presence of the vaccine virus strain in any stool sample \nfrom a twin receiving placebo. \nTransmitted vaccine virus was identified in 15 of 80 twins receiving placebo (18.8% [95% CI: \n10.9, 29.0]). Median duration of the rotavirus shedding was 10 days in twins who received \nROTARIX as compared with 4 days in twins who received placebo in whom the vaccine virus \nwas transmitted. In the 15 twins who received placebo, no gastrointestinal symptoms related to \ntransmitted vaccine virus were observed. \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nROTARIX has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of \nfertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \nThere are two formulations of ROTARIX: a reconstituted lyophilized formulation (supplied in a \nvial and oral dosing applicator presentation) and a liquid formulation (supplied in an oral dosing \napplicator only presentation) [see Description (11)]. Efficacy was evaluated using the \n17 \n \nreconstituted lyophilized formulation [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.3)]. These data are \nrelevant to the liquid formulation because both formulations contain the same live, attenuated \nrotavirus strain and are manufactured using a similar process. \n14.1 \nEfficacy Studies  \nThe data demonstrating the efficacy of ROTARIX in preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis come \nfrom 24,163 infants randomized in two placebo-controlled studies conducted in 17 countries in \nEurope and Latin America (Studies 5 and 8). In these studies, oral polio vaccine (OPV) was not \ncoadministered; however, other routine childhood vaccines could be concomitantly administered. \nBreastfeeding was permitted in both studies. \nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 6 European countries \n(Study 5). A total of 3,994 infants were enrolled to receive ROTARIX (n = 2,646) or placebo \n(n = 1,348). Vaccine or placebo was given to healthy infants as a 2-dose series with the first dose \nadministered orally from 6 through 14 weeks of age followed by one additional dose \nadministered at least 4 weeks after the first dose. The 2-dose series was completed by 24 weeks \nof age. For both vaccination groups, 98.3% of infants were White and 53% were male. \nThe clinical case definition of rotavirus gastroenteritis was an episode of diarrhea (passage of 3 \nor more loose or watery stools within a day), with or without vomiting, where rotavirus was \nidentified in a stool sample. Severity of gastroenteritis was determined by a clinical scoring \nsystem, the Vesikari scale, assessing the duration and intensity of diarrhea and vomiting, the \nintensity of fever, use of rehydration therapy, or hospitalization for each episode. Scores range \nfrom 0 to 20, where higher scores indicate greater severity. An episode of gastroenteritis with a \nscore of 11 or greater was considered severe.6 \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was prevention of any grade of severity of rotavirus \ngastroenteritis caused by naturally occurring rotavirus from 2 weeks after the second dose \nthrough one rotavirus season (according to protocol, ATP). Other efficacy evaluations included \nprevention of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis, as defined by the Vesikari scale, and reductions in \nhospitalizations due to rotavirus gastroenteritis and all-cause gastroenteritis regardless of \npresumed etiology. Analyses were also done to evaluate the efficacy of ROTARIX against \nrotavirus gastroenteritis among infants who received at least one vaccination (total vaccinated \ncohort, TVC). \nEfficacy of ROTARIX against any grade of severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis through one \nrotavirus season was 87.1% (95% CI: 79.6, 92.1); TVC efficacy was 87.3% (95% CI: 80.3, \n92.0). Efficacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis through one rotavirus season was 95.8% \n(95% CI: 89.6, 98.7); TVC efficacy was 96.0% (95% CI: 90.2, 98.8) (Table 5). The protective \neffect of ROTARIX against any grade of severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis observed \nimmediately following Dose 1 administration and prior to Dose 2 was 89.8% (95% CI: 8.9, \n99.8). \n18 \n \nEfficacy of ROTARIX in reducing hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis through one \nrotavirus season was 100% (95% CI: 81.8, 100); TVC efficacy was 100% (95% CI: 81.7, 100) \n(Table 5). ROTARIX reduced hospitalizations for all-cause gastroenteritis regardless of \npresumed etiology by 74.7% (95% CI: 45.5, 88.9). \nTable 5.

A total of 63,225 infants received ROTARIX (n = 31,673) or \nplacebo (n = 31,552). An efficacy subset of these infants consisting of 20,169 infants from Latin \nAmerica received ROTARIX (n = 10,159) or placebo (n = 10,010). Vaccine or placebo was \ngiven to healthy infants as a 2-dose series with the first dose administered orally from 6 through \n13 weeks of age followed by one additional dose administered at least 4 weeks after the first \ndose. The 2-dose series was completed by 24 weeks of age. For both vaccination groups, the \nracial distribution of the efficacy subset was as follows: Hispanic 85.8%, White 7.9%, Black \n1.1%, and other 5.2%; 51% were male. \n19 \n \nThe clinical case definition of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was an episode of diarrhea \n(passage of 3 or more loose or watery stools within a day), with or without vomiting, where \nrotavirus was identified in a stool sample, requiring hospitalization and/or rehydration therapy \nequivalent to World Health Organization (WHO) plan B (oral rehydration therapy) or plan C \n(intravenous rehydration therapy) in a medical facility. \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was prevention of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by \nnaturally occurring rotavirus from 2 weeks after the second dose through one year (ATP). \nAnalyses were done to evaluate the efficacy of ROTARIX against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis \namong infants who received at least one vaccination (TVC). Reduction in hospitalizations due to \nrotavirus gastroenteritis was also evaluated (ATP). \nEfficacy of ROTARIX against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis through one year was 84.7% (95% \nCI: 71.7, 92.4); TVC efficacy was 81.1% (95% CI: 68.5, 89.3) (Table 6). \nEfficacy of ROTARIX in reducing hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis through one year \nwas 85.0% (95% CI: 69.6, 93.5); TVC efficacy was 80.8% (95% CI: 65.7, 90.0) (Table 6). \nTable 6.

Efficacy \nin preventing any grade of severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis cases occurring only during the \nsecond season post-vaccination was 71.9% (95% CI: 61.2, 79.8). The efficacy of ROTARIX \nagainst severe rotavirus gastroenteritis through two rotavirus seasons was 90.4% (95% CI: 85.1, \n94.1). Efficacy in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis cases occurring only during the \nsecond season post-vaccination was 85.6% (95% CI: 75.8, 91.9). \nThe efficacy of ROTARIX in reducing hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis through two \nrotavirus seasons was 96.0% (95% CI: 83.8, 99.5). \nIn the Latin American study (Study 8), the efficacy of ROTARIX against severe rotavirus \ngastroenteritis through two years was 80.5% (95% CI: 71.3, 87.1). Efficacy in preventing severe \nrotavirus gastroenteritis cases occurring only during the second year post-vaccination was 79.0% \n(95% CI: 66.4, 87.4). The efficacy of ROTARIX in reducing hospitalizations for rotavirus \ngastroenteritis through two years was 83.0% (95% CI: 73.1, 89.7). \nThe efficacy of ROTARIX beyond the second season post-vaccination was not evaluated. \n14.3 \nEfficacy against Specific Rotavirus Types  \nThe type-specific efficacy against any grade of severity and severe rotavirus gastroenteritis \ncaused by G1P[8], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8], and combined non-G1 (G2, G3, G4, G9) types was \nstatistically significant through one year.

Seroconversion was defined as the appearance \nof anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies (concentration 20 U/mL) post-vaccination in the serum of \ninfants previously negative for rotavirus. \nIn 2 safety and efficacy studies (Studies 5 and 8), one to two months after a 2-dose series, 86.5% \nof 787 recipients of ROTARIX reconstituted lyophilized formulation seroconverted compared \nwith 6.7% of 420 placebo recipients, and 76.8% of 393 recipients of ROTARIX reconstituted \nlyophilized formulation seroconverted compared with 9.7% of 341 placebo recipients, \nrespectively. \nImmunogenicity of a 2-dose series of ROTARIX liquid formulation was evaluated in Study 9. \nThis study compared seroconversion rates and Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs) \nfollowing administration of the ROTARIX liquid formulation (n = 984) or the ROTARIX \nreconstituted lyophilized formulation (n = 329). The primary analyses demonstrated non-\ninferiority of IgA seroconversion rates and GMCs at 1 to 2 months post-vaccination for the \nROTARIX liquid formulation group compared to the ROTARIX reconstituted lyophilized \nformulation group (Lower Limit of the 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates ≥-10%; \nLower Limit of the 95% CI for the GMC ratio ≥0.67). \nIn Study 10, 3 months after a 2-dose series, the percentage of subjects with anti-rotavirus IgA \nantibodies (concentration ≥20 U/mL) was comparable after administration of the ROTARIX \nliquid formulation (76.3% of 417) and the ROTARIX reconstituted lyophilized formulation \n(78.9% of 426). \n14.5 \nConcomitant Vaccine Administration  \nIn clinical trials, ROTARIX was administered concomitantly with U.S.-licensed and non–U.S.-\nlicensed vaccines. In a U.S. concomitant vaccine administration study (Study 18) using \nROTARIX (reconstituted lyophilized formulation) in 484 infants, there was no evidence of \ninterference in the immune responses to any of the antigens when PEDIARIX [Diphtheria and \nTetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Hepatitis B (Recombinant) and Inactivated \nPoliovirus Vaccine], a U.S.-licensed 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Wyeth \nPharmaceuticals Inc.), and a U.S.-licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur SA) \nwere concomitantly administered with ROTARIX as compared with separate administration of \nROTARIX. \nIn a concomitant vaccine administration study (Study 10) in 1,272 infants, non-inferiority was \ndemonstrated regarding the immune response to each of the antigens in PEDIARIX, HIBERIX \n[Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate)], and a U.S.-licensed, 13-valent \npneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Pfizer Inc.) when concomitantly administered with the \n23 \n \nROTARIX liquid formulation as compared to when concomitantly administered with the \nROTARIX reconstituted lyophilized formulation. \n15 \nREFERENCES  \n1.

Rotavirus can cause diarrhea and vomiting that is so bad that your baby can lose \ntoo much body fluid and need to go to the hospital. \nRotavirus vaccine is a liquid that is given to your baby by mouth. It is not an injection. \nWho should not take ROTARIX? \nYour baby should not get ROTARIX if: \n• \nhe or she has had an allergic reaction after getting a dose of ROTARIX. \n• \nhe or she is allergic to any of the ingredients of this vaccine. A list of ingredients can be found at the \nend of this leaflet. \n• \na doctor has told you that your baby’s digestive system has a defect (is not normal). \n• \nhe or she has a history of a serious problem called intussusception that happens when a part of the \nintestine gets blocked or twisted. \n• \nhe or she has Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID), a severe problem with his/her \nimmune system. \nTell your doctor if your baby: \n• \nis allergic to latex. \n• \nhas problems with his/her immune system. \n• \nhas cancer. \n• \nwill be in close contact with someone who has problems with his/her immune system or is getting \ntreated for cancer, as the spread of vaccine virus to non-vaccinated contacts could occur. Hand \nwashing is recommended after diaper changes to help prevent the spread of vaccine virus. \nIf your baby has been having diarrhea and vomiting, your doctor may want to wait before giving your \nbaby a dose of ROTARIX. \n2 \n \nHow is ROTARIX given?  \nROTARIX is a liquid that is dropped into your baby’s mouth and swallowed. \n \nYour baby will get the first dose at around 6 weeks old. \nThe second dose will be at least 4 weeks after the first dose (before 6 months old). \nBe sure to plan the time for your baby’s second dose with the doctor because it is important that your \nbaby gets both doses of ROTARIX before your baby is 6 months old. \nThe doctor may decide to give your baby other vaccines at the same time as ROTARIX. \nYour baby can be fed normally after getting ROTARIX.  \nWhat are possible side effects of ROTARIX?  \nThe most common side effects of ROTARIX are: \n• \ncrying \n• \nfussiness \n• \ncough \n• \nrunny nose \n• \nfever \n• \nloss of appetite \n• \nvomiting. \nCall your doctor right away or go to the emergency department if your baby has any of these problems \nafter getting ROTARIX, even if it has been several weeks since the last vaccine dose because these may \nbe signs of a serious problem called intussusception: \n• \nbad vomiting \n• \nbad diarrhea \n• \nbloody bowel movement \n• \nhigh fever \n• \nsevere stomach pain (if your baby brings his/her knees to his/her chest while crying or screaming). \nStudies showed an increased risk of intussusception after the first and second dose of vaccine, \nespecially in the first 7 days. \nSince FDA approval, reports of infants with intussusception have been received by Vaccine Adverse \nEvent Reporting System (VAERS). Intussusception occurred days and sometimes weeks after \nvaccination. Some infants needed hospitalization, surgery on their intestines, or a special enema to treat \nthis problem. Death due to intussusception has occurred. \n3 \n \nOther reported side effects include: Kawasaki disease (a serious condition that can affect the heart; \nsymptoms may include fever, rash, red eyes, red mouth, swollen glands, swollen hands and feet, and, if \nnot treated, death can occur). \nTalk to your baby’s doctor if your baby has any problems that concern you. \nWhat are the ingredients in ROTARIX?  \nThere are two formulations of Rotarix, one that requires your vaccination provider to mix a freeze-dried \ncomponent with a liquid component and one that is provided as a liquid that does not require mixing. \nYour provider can tell you the formulation your baby will receive. \nFormulation that requires mixing \nThis formulation of ROTARIX contains weakened human rotavirus. \nThis formulation of ROTARIX also contains calcium carbonate, dextran, sorbitol, sucrose, amino acids, \nxanthan, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), and sterile water. The ingredients of DMEM are \nas follows: sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium sulphate, ferric (III) nitrate, sodium \ndihydrogen phosphate, sodium pyruvate, D-glucose, concentrated vitamin solution, L-cystine, L-tyrosine, \namino acids solution, L-glutamine, calcium chloride, and sodium hydrogenocarbonate. \nPorcine circovirus type 1 (PCV-1), a virus found in pigs, is present in this formulation of ROTARIX. PCV-\n1 is not known to cause disease in humans. \nThis formulation of ROTARIX contains no preservatives. \nThe tip cap of the dropper used to give your baby ROTARIX contains latex. \nFormulation that does not require mixing \nThis formulation of ROTARIX contains weakened human rotavirus. \nThis formulation of ROTARIX also contains disodium adipate, sucrose, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle \nMedium (DMEM), and sterile water. The ingredients of DMEM are as follows: sodium chloride, potassium \nchloride, magnesium sulphate, ferric (III) nitrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium pyruvate, D-\nglucose, concentrated vitamin solution, L-cystine, L-tyrosine, amino acids solution, L-glutamine, calcium \nchloride, and sodium hydrogenocarbonate. \nThis formulation of ROTARIX contains no preservatives. \nThe tip cap of the dropper used to give your baby ROTARIX contains latex. \n \nManufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals  \nRixensart, Belgium, U.S. License 1617 \nDistributed by GlaxoSmithKline \nDurham, NC 27701 \nTrademarks are owned by or licensed to the GSK group of companies. \n©xxxx GSK group of companies or its licensor. \nRTX:xxPIL \nThis Patient Information has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration.  \nRevised: xx/xxxx  \n \n"

Solicited local and systemic reactions and unsolicited adverse events were monitored daily for 14 days post vaccination using a diary card. From days 14 to 28 post vaccination, information on adverse events necessitating a medical contact, such as a telephone call, visit to an emergency room, physician's office or hospitalization, was obtained via telephone interview or at an interim clinic visit. From days 28 to 6 months post vaccination, participants were monitored for unexpected visits to a physician's office or to an emergency room, onset of serious illness, and hospitalizations. In study NCT01439165 when a second vaccination of Adacel was administered 8-12 years following the initial vaccination of Adacel, solicited adverse reactions were monitored for 7 days post-vaccination using a diary card.

Adacel is approved for \nuse in individuals 10 through 64 years of age. \nImmunization during the third trimester of pregnancy to prevent pertussis in infants younger than \n2 months of age.   \n2 \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  \nFor intramuscular injection only. \n2.1 \nPreparation for Administration  \nJust before use, shake the vial or syringe well until a uniform, white, cloudy suspension results. \nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration \nprior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions \nexist, the vaccine should not be administered. \nWithdraw the 0.5 mL dose of vaccine from the single-dose vial using a sterile needle and \nsyringe. \nAdacel should not be combined through reconstitution or mixed with any other vaccine. Discard \nunused portion in vial. \n2.2 \nAdministration, Dose and Schedule  \nAdacel is administered as a single 0.5 mL intramuscular injection. \nRoutine Booster Vaccination \nA first dose of Adacel is administered 5 years or more after the last dose of the Diphtheria and \nTetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis (DTaP) series or 5 years or more after a dose of Tetanus \nand Diphtheria Toxoids Adsorbed (Td). A second dose of Adacel may be administered 8 years or \nmore after the first dose of Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis \nVaccine Adsorbed (Tdap). \nVaccination During the Third Trimester of Pregnancy  \nTo prevent pertussis in infants younger than 2 months of age, administer Adacel to pregnant \nindividuals during the third trimester of pregnancy.  \nWound Management \nAdacel may be administered for tetanus prophylaxis for wound management. For management of \na tetanus prone wound, a booster dose of Adacel may be administered if at least 5 years have \nelapsed since previous receipt of a tetanus toxoid containing vaccine. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nAdacel is a suspension for injection available in 0.5 mL single-dose vials and prefilled syringes. \n[See HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING (16).] \n \n3 \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity  \nA severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any tetanus toxoid, \ndiphtheria toxoid or pertussis containing vaccine or any other component of this vaccine is a \ncontraindication to administration of Adacel. [See DESCRIPTION (11).] Because of uncertainty \nas to which component of the vaccine may be responsible, none of the components should be \nadministered. Alternatively, such individuals may be referred to an allergist for evaluation if \nfurther immunizations are to be considered. \n4.2 \nEncephalopathy  \nEncephalopathy (e.g., coma, prolonged seizures, or decreased level of consciousness) within 7 \ndays of a previous dose of a pertussis containing vaccine not attributable to another identifiable \ncause is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis containing vaccine, including \nAdacel. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nManagement of Acute Allergic Reactions  \nEpinephrine hydrochloride solution (1:1,000) and other appropriate agents and equipment must \nbe available for immediate use in case an anaphylactic or acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs. \n5.2 \nGuillain-Barré Syndrome and Brachial Neuritis  \nIf Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of prior vaccine containing \ntetanus toxoid, the risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome may be increased following a dose of \nAdacel. A review by the Institute of Medicine found evidence for acceptance of a causal relation \nbetween tetanus toxoid and brachial neuritis. (1) \n5.3 \nProgressive or Unstable Neurologic Disorders  \nProgressive or unstable neurologic conditions are reasons to defer Adacel. It is not known \nwhether administration of Adacel to persons with an unstable or progressive neurologic disorder \nmight hasten manifestations of the disorder or affect the prognosis. Administration of Adacel to \npersons with an unstable or progressive neurologic disorder may result in diagnostic confusion \nbetween manifestations of the underlying illness and possible adverse effects of vaccination. \n5.4 \nArthus-Type Hypersensitivity  \nPersons who experienced an Arthus-type hypersensitivity reaction following a prior dose of a \ntetanus toxoid-containing vaccine should not receive Adacel unless at least 10 years have elapsed \nsince the last dose of a tetanus toxoid containing vaccine. \n5.5 \nAltered Immunocompetence  \nIf Adacel is administered to immunocompromised persons, including persons receiving \nimmunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained. [See DRUG \nINTERACTIONS (7.2).] \n5.6 \nSyncope  \nSyncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccine, including \nAdacel. Procedures should be in place to prevent falling injury and manage syncopal reactions. \n \n4 \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction \ninformation from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events \nthat appear to be related to vaccine use and for approximating rates of those events. As with any \nvaccine, there is the possibility that broad use of Adacel could reveal adverse reactions not \nobserved in clinical trials. \nThe safety of a first vaccination with Adacel was evaluated in 5 clinical studies. Three of the \nstudies were conducted in the U.S. and 2 were conducted in Canada. Of the study participants, \n86% were Caucasian, 8% Black, 3% Hispanic, 1% Asian and 2% of other ethnic origin. A total \nof 7,143 individuals 10 through 64 years of age inclusive (4,695 adolescents 10 through 17 years \nof age and 2,448 adults 18 through 64 years of age) received a single dose of Adacel. \nU.S. Adolescent and Adult Study of a First Vaccination with Adacel (Td506) \nClinical study Td506 was a randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled trial that enrolled \nadolescents 11 through 17 years of age (Adacel N = 1,184; DECAVAC (Tetanus and Diphtheria \nToxoids Adsorbed; manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc., Swiftwater, PA) N = 792) and adults 18 \nthrough 64 years of age (Adacel N = 1,752; DECAVAC N = 573). Study participants had not \nreceived tetanus or diphtheria-containing vaccines within the previous 5 years. Solicited local \nand systemic reactions and unsolicited adverse events were monitored daily for 14 days post \nvaccination using a diary card. From days 14 to 28 post vaccination, information on adverse \nevents necessitating a medical contact, such as a telephone call, visit to an emergency room, \nphysician’s office or hospitalization, was obtained via telephone interview or at an interim clinic \nvisit. From days 28 to 6 months post vaccination, participants were monitored for unexpected \nvisits to a physician’s office or to an emergency room, onset of serious illness, and \nhospitalizations. Information regarding adverse events that occurred in the 6-month post \nvaccination time period was obtained from participants via telephone contact. At least 96% of \nparticipants completed the 6-month follow-up evaluation. \nThe frequency of selected solicited adverse reactions (erythema, swelling, pain and fever) \noccurring during days 0 to 14 following vaccination with Adacel or Td vaccine in adolescents 11 \nthrough 17 years of age and adults 18 through 64 years of age are presented in Table 1. Most of \nthese reactions were reported at a similar frequency in recipients of both Adacel and Td vaccine. \nPain at the injection site was the most common adverse reaction in 62.9% to 77.8% of all \nvaccinees. In addition, overall rates of pain were higher in adolescent recipients of Adacel \ncompared to Td vaccine recipients. Rates of moderate and severe pain in adolescents did not \nsignificantly differ between the Adacel and Td vaccine groups. Among adults, the rates of pain \nafter receipt of Adacel or Td vaccine did not significantly differ. Fever of 38°C and higher was \nuncommon, although in the adolescent age group it occurred significantly more frequently in \nAdacel recipients than Td vaccine recipients. \n \n5 \nTable 1: Frequencies of Solicited Injection Site Reactions and Fever for Adolescents and \nAdults, Days 0-14, Following a First Vaccination with Adacel or Td Vaccine in Study \nTd506 \nAdverse Reactions* \nAdolescents \n11-17 years \nAdacel \nN† = 1,170-1,175 \n(%) \nAdolescents \n11-17 years \nTd‡ \nN† = 783-787 (%) \nAdults \n18-64 years \nAdacel \nN† = 1,688-1,698 \n(%) \nAdults \n18-64 years \nTd‡ \nN† = 551-561 \n(%) \nInjection Site  \nPain, Any \n77.8§ \n71.0 \n65.7 \n62.9 \nInjection Site  \nPain, Moderate¶ \n18.0 \n15.6 \n15.1 \n10.2 \nInjection Site  \nPain, Severe# \n1.5 \n0.6 \n1.1 \n0.9 \nInjection Site Swelling, \nAny \n20.9 \n18.3 \n21.0 \n17.3 \nInjection Site Swelling, \nModerate¶ 1.0 to 3.4 cm \n6.5 \n5.7 \n7.6 \n5.4 \nInjection Site Swelling, \nSevere# ≥3.5 cm \n6.4 \n5.5 \n5.8 \n5.5 \nInjection Site Swelling, \nSevere# ≥5 cm (2 inches) \n2.8 \n3.6 \n3.2 \n2.7 \nInjection Site Swelling, \nAny \n20.8 \n19.7 \n24.7 \n21.6 \nInjection Site Swelling, \nModerate¶1.0 to 3.4 cm \n5.9 \n4.6 \n8.0 \n8.4 \nInjection Site Swelling,  \nSevere#≥3.5 cm \n6.0 \n5.3 \n6.2 \n4.8 \nInjection Site Swelling, \nSevere#≥5 cm (2 inches) \n2.7 \n2.9 \n4.0 \n3.0 \nFever, ≥38.0°C \n(≥100.4°F) \n5.0§ \n2.7 \n1.4 \n1.1 \nFever, ≥38.8°C to \n≤39.4°C  \n(≥102.0°F to ≤103.0°F) \n0.9 \n0.6 \n0.4 \n0.2 \nFever, ≥39.5°C \n(≥103.1°F) \n0.2 \n0.1 \n0.0 \n0.2 \n* The study sample size was designed to detect >10% differences between Adacel and Td vaccines for events of \n‘Any’ intensity. \n† \nN = number of participants with available data. \n‡ \nTetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids Adsorbed manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc., Swiftwater, PA. \n§ \nAdacel did not meet the non-inferiority criterion for rates of ‘Any’ Pain in adolescents compared to Td vaccine \nrates (upper limit of the 95% CI on the difference for Adacel minus Td vaccine was 10.7% whereas the criterion \nwas <10%).

Most injection site reactions occurred within the \n \n7 \nfirst 3 days after vaccination (with a mean duration of less than 3 days). The rates of unsolicited \nadverse events reported from days 14-28 post-vaccination were comparable between the two \nvaccine groups, as were the rates of unsolicited adverse events from day 28 through 6 months. \nThere were no spontaneous reports of extensive limb swelling of the injected limb in study \nTd506, nor in the other three studies which also contributed to the safety database for Adacel. \nAdult Study of a Second Vaccination with Adacel (NCT01439165) \nIn a randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled, multi-center study (NCT01439165), adults 18 \nthrough 64 years of age who had received a first dose of Adacel 8-12 years previously were \nenrolled and randomized to receive either Adacel (N = 1002) or a US licensed Td vaccine, \nTENIVAC (Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids Adsorbed; manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, \nLimited) (N = 328). Subjects were recruited from the primary licensure study Td506 and the \nCanadian general public and had not received Td or Tdap vaccine since their initial Adacel dose. \nThe demographic characteristics for study participants were similar for both vaccine groups. The \nmean ages were 28.9 years for the Adacel group and 29.2 years for the Td group. Overall, there \nwere more female participants in both the Adacel group and Td group; 64.5% and 64.6%, \nrespectively. In both vaccine groups, greater than 94% of subjects identified as white and 99% as \nnon-Hispanic or Latino. \nSafety data were collected from all participants who received the study vaccine (N = 999 for the \nAdacel group; N = 328 for the Td group). Solicited local and systemic reactions and unsolicited \nadverse events were monitored for 7 days post-vaccination using a diary card. Unsolicited \nadverse events were collected for approximately 28 days post-vaccination.

The mean age of subjects was 31.7 years, there were more females (52.2%) than males \n(47.8%) and 89.9% of subjects were Caucasian. Solicited adverse reactions were collected for 14 \ndays following vaccination. SAEs were monitored for 6 months following vaccination.  A total \nof 545 subjects 16-69 years of age were enrolled. All participants in this study received a first \ndose of Adacel vaccine as part of Sanofi Pasteur studies Td501, Td502, or Td505. \nApproximately 90% of the participants had at least one solicited injection site reaction. The most \nfrequently reported injection site reactions were pain in 87.6% of subjects, followed by \nerythema/redness in 28.6%, and swelling in 25.6%. Approximately 77% of the participants had \nat least one solicited systemic reaction. The most frequently reported solicited systemic adverse \nreactions in subjects who received a second dose of Adacel were myalgia (61%), followed by \nheadache (53.2%), malaise (38.2%), and fever (6.5%). \n \n9 \nInjection Site and Systemic Reactions Following Adacel Given Concomitantly with \nHepatitis B Vaccine \nIn the concomitant vaccination study with Adacel (first vaccination) and Hepatitis B vaccine \n[Recombivax HB] (Td501) [See CLINICAL STUDIES (14)], injection site and systemic adverse \nevents were monitored daily for 14 days post-vaccination using a diary card. Injection site \nadverse events were only monitored at site/arm of Adacel administration. Unsolicited reactions \n(including immediate reactions, serious adverse events and events that elicited seeking medical \nattention) were collected at a clinic visit or via telephone interview for the duration of the trial, \ni.e., up to 6 months post-vaccination. \nThe rates reported for fever and injection site pain (at the Adacel administration site) were \nsimilar when Adacel and Hepatitis B vaccine were given concurrently or separately. However, \nthe rates of injection site erythema (23.4% for concomitant vaccination and 21.4% for separate \nadministration) and swelling (23.9% for concomitant vaccination and 17.9% for separate \nadministration) at the Adacel administration site were increased when coadministered. Swollen \nand/or sore joints were reported by 22.5% for concomitant vaccination and 17.9% for separate \nadministration. The rates of generalized body aches in the individuals who reported swollen \nand/or sore joints were 86.7% for concomitant vaccination and 72.2% for separate \nadministration. Most joint complaints were mild in intensity with a mean duration of 1.8 days. \nThe incidence of other solicited and unsolicited adverse events were not different between the \n2 study groups. \nInjection Site and Systemic Reactions Following Adacel Given Concomitantly with \nTrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (TIV) \nIn the concomitant vaccination study with Adacel (first vaccination) and trivalent inactivated \ninfluenza vaccine [Fluzone] (Td502) [See CLINICAL STUDIES (14)], injection site and systemic \nadverse events were monitored for 14 days post-vaccination using a diary card. All unsolicited \nreactions occurring through day 14 were collected. From day 14 to the end of the trial, i.e., up to \n84 days, only events that elicited seeking medical attention were collected. \nThe rates of fever and injection site erythema and swelling were similar for recipients of \nconcurrent and separate administration of Adacel and TIV. However, pain at the Adacel injection \nsite occurred at statistically higher rates following concurrent administration (66.6%) versus \nseparate administration (60.8%). The rates of sore and/or swollen joints were 13% for concurrent \nadministration and 9% for separate administration. Most joint complaints were mild in intensity \nwith a mean duration of 2.0 days. The incidence of other solicited and unsolicited adverse events \nwas similar between the 2 study groups. \nAdditional Studies \nIn an additional study (Td505), 1,806 adolescents 11 through 17 years of age received Adacel \n(first vaccination) as part of the lot consistency study used to support Adacel licensure. This \nstudy was a randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial designed to assess lot consistency as \nmeasured by the safety and immunogenicity of 3 lots of Adacel when given as a booster dose to \nadolescents 11 through 17 years of age inclusive. Local and systemic adverse events were \nmonitored for 14 days post-vaccination using a diary card. Unsolicited adverse events and \nserious adverse events were collected for 28 days post-vaccination. Pain was the most frequently \nreported local adverse event occurring in approximately 80% of all participants. Headache was \n \n10 \nthe most frequently reported systemic event occurring in approximately 44% of all participants. \nSore and/or swollen joints were reported by approximately 14% of participants. Most joint \ncomplaints were mild in intensity with a mean duration of 2.0 days. \nAn additional 962 adolescents and adults received Adacel in three supportive Canadian studies \n(TC9704, Td9707 and TD9805) used as the basis for licensure in other countries. Within these \nclinical trials, the rates of local and systemic reactions following the first vaccination with \nAdacel were similar to those reported in the four principal trials in the U.S. with the exception of \na higher rate (86%) of adults experiencing “any” local injection site pain. The rate of severe pain \n(0.8%), however, was comparable to the rates reported in four principal trials conducted in the \nUS. There was one spontaneous report of whole-arm swelling of the injected limb among the 277 \nTd vaccine recipients, and two spontaneous reports among the 962 Adacel recipients in the \nsupportive Canadian studies. \nAn additional study (NCT01311557) enrolled 1,302 individuals in an open label, two-arm, \nmulticenter trial (651 participants in each group) to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a \nfirst vaccination with Adacel administered to persons 10 to <11 years of age compared to \npersons 11 to <12 years of age. Immediate reactions were monitored for 20 minutes post-\nvaccination.  Solicited local and systemic adverse events were monitored for 7 days post-\nvaccination using a diary card. Unsolicited and serious adverse events were collected for \napproximately 30 days post-vaccination. Similar rates of immediate, solicited and unsolicited \nadverse reactions were reported in each of the two age cohorts. One serious adverse event, not \nrelated to vaccination, was reported in the younger age group. \nSerious Adverse Events \nThroughout the 6-month follow-up period following a first vaccination with Adacel in study \nTd506, SAEs were reported in 1.5% of Adacel recipients and in 1.4% of Td vaccine recipients. \nTwo SAEs in adults were neuropathic events that occurred within 28 days of Adacel \nadministration; one severe migraine with unilateral facial paralysis and one diagnosis of nerve \ncompression in neck and left arm. Similar or lower rates of serious adverse events were reported \nin the other trials following a first vaccination with Adacel in participants up to 64 years of age \nand no additional neuropathic events were reported. \nIn study NCT01439165 when a second vaccination of Adacel was administered 8-12 years \nfollowing the initial vaccination of Adacel, a total of 8 participants (0.8%) in the Adacel group \nand 1 participant (0.3%) in the Td group reported SAEs during the 6-month follow-up period. \nAll SAEs were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study vaccine. \nIn study NCT00347958, seven participants experienced an SAE, all of which were considered by \nthe investigator to be unrelated to the study vaccine. \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience  \nThe following adverse events of Adacel have been spontaneously reported in the US and other \ncountries. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it \nmay not be possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to \nvaccine exposure. \nThe following adverse events were included based on one or more of the following factors: \nseverity, frequency of reporting, or strength of evidence for a causal relationship to Adacel. \n \n11 \n• \nImmune system disorders \nAnaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity reaction (angioedema, edema, rash, hypotension) \n• \nNervous system disorders \nParesthesia, hypoesthesia, Guillain-Barré syndrome, brachial neuritis, facial palsy, \nconvulsion, syncope, myelitis \n• \nCardiac disorders \nMyocarditis \n• \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nPruritus, urticaria \n• \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nMyositis, muscle spasm \n• \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions  \nLarge injection site reactions (>50 mm), extensive limb swelling from the injection site \nbeyond one or both joints \nInjection site bruising, injection site nodule, sterile abscess, Arthus hypersensitivity \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 \nConcomitant Vaccine Administration  \nWhen Adacel is administered concomitantly with other injectable vaccines or Tetanus Immune \nGlobulin, they should be given with separate syringes and at different injection sites. Adacel \nshould not be mixed with any other vaccine in the same syringe or vial. \nTrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (TIV) \nIn a clinical study Adacel (first vaccination) was administered concomitantly with a US-licensed \ntrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). [See ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) and CLINICAL \nSTUDIES (14).] \nNo interference in tetanus and diphtheria seroprotection rates and responses to influenza vaccine, \ndetoxified pertussis toxin (PT), fimbriae types 2 and 3 (FIM) or filamentous hemagglutinin \n(FHA) were observed when Adacel vaccine was administered concomitantly with TIV compared \nto separate administration. A lower pertactin (PRN) GMC was observed when Adacel was \nadministered concomitantly with TIV compared to separate administration. \n7.2 \nImmunosuppressive Treatments  \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic \ndrugs and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune \nresponse to vaccines. [See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6).] \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.1 \nPregnancy  \nPregnancy Exposure Registry \nThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to \nAdacel during pregnancy. Women who receive Adacel during pregnancy are encouraged to \ncontact directly, or have their healthcare professional contact, Sanofi Pasteur Inc. at 1-800-822-\n2463 (1-800-VACCINE) or online at https://www.sanofipasteurpregnancyregistry.com. \n \n12 \nRisk Summary \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the US general \npopulation, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically \nrecognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.  \nAvailable data suggest the rates of major birth defects and miscarriage in women who receive \nAdacel within 30 days prior to pregnancy or during pregnancy are consistent with estimated \nbackground rates. (See Human Data) \nTwo developmental toxicity studies were performed in female rabbits given 0.5 mL (a single \nhuman dose) of Adacel twice prior and during gestation. The studies revealed no evidence of \nharm to the fetus due to Adacel. (See Animal Data) \nData \nHuman Data \nA retrospective passive surveillance study (NCT00258882) included women who received \nAdacel during pregnancy (n=225) and controls (n=675) matched by age and date of first positive \npregnancy test. Of the 225 Adacel recipients, 39 women received Adacel within two weeks prior \nto the date of their last menstrual period (LMP), 110 were vaccinated during the 1st trimester (< \n12 weeks gestation), 33 during the 2nd trimester (12 to < 27 weeks gestation), 14 in 3rd trimester \n(11 from 27 to <36 weeks gestation and 3 from ≥36 weeks gestation), and 29 were unknown. \nThere were 21 reports of spontaneous abortion (9.3%) and 15 congenital anomalies (6.7%) in the \nAdacel exposed group, and 102 spontaneous abortions (15%) and 57 congenital anomalies \n(8.4%) in the control group. \nAn assessment of data from the ongoing pregnancy registry included 1236 prospective reports of \nexposure to Adacel during pregnancy since 10 June 2005 through 16 October 2022. Among the \n286 reports with known pregnancy outcomes, 118 women were exposed to Adacel in the first \ntrimester with 1 congenital anomaly and 14 spontaneous abortions; 54 women were exposed to \nAdacel in the second trimester with one congenital anomaly; 114 women were exposed to \nAdacel in the third trimester with 2 congenital anomalies; 76 women were exposed to Adacel at \nan unknown trimester with 1 congenital anomaly. The rates of assessed outcomes in the \nprospective population were consistent with estimated background rates. \nAnimal Data \nThe effect of Adacel on embryo-fetal and pre-weaning development was evaluated in two \ndevelopmental toxicity studies in female rabbits. Animals were administered 0.5 mL (a single \nhuman dose) of Adacel twice prior to gestation, during the period of organogenesis (gestation \nday 6) and later during pregnancy on gestation day 29. No adverse effects on pregnancy, \nparturition, lactation, embryo-fetal or pre-weaning development were observed. There were no \nvaccine related fetal malformations or other evidence of teratogenesis noted in this study. \n8.2 \nLactation  \nRisk Summary \nIt is not known whether Adacel vaccine components are excreted in human milk. Data are not \navailable to assess the effect of administration of Adacel on breast-fed infants or on milk \n \n13 \nproduction/excretion. \nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the \nmother’s clinical need for Adacel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from \nAdacel or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying \nmaternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nAdacel is not approved for individuals less than 10 years of age. Safety and effectiveness of \nAdacel in persons less than 10 years of age in the U.S. have not been established. \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use  \nAdacel is not approved for use in individuals 65 years of age and older. \nIn a clinical study, individuals 65 years of age and older received a single dose of Adacel. Based \non prespecified criteria, persons 65 years of age and older who received a dose of Adacel had \nlower geometric mean concentrations of antibodies to PT, PRN and FIM when compared to \ninfants who had received a primary series of DAPTACEL®, Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and \nAcellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (DTaP). [See CLINICAL STUDIES (14) for description of \nDAPTACEL.] \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nAdacel is a sterile isotonic suspension of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and pertussis antigens \nadsorbed on aluminum phosphate, for intramuscular injection. \nEach 0.5 mL dose contains 5 Lf tetanus toxoid (T), 2 Lf diphtheria toxoid (d), and acellular \npertussis antigens [2.5 mcg detoxified pertussis toxin (PT), 5 mcg filamentous hemagglutinin \n(FHA), 3 mcg pertactin (PRN), 5 mcg fimbriae types 2 and 3 (FIM)]. Other ingredients per 0.5 \nmL dose include 1.5 mg aluminum phosphate (0.33 mg aluminum) as the adjuvant, ≤5 mcg \nresidual formaldehyde, <50 ng residual glutaraldehyde and 3.3 mg (0.6% v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol \n(not as a preservative). The antigens are the same as those in DAPTACEL; however, Adacel is \nformulated with reduced quantities of diphtheria and detoxified PT. \nThe acellular pertussis vaccine components are produced from Bordetella pertussis cultures \ngrown in Stainer-Scholte medium (2) modified by the addition of casamino acids and dimethyl-\nbeta-cyclodextrin. PT, FHA and PRN are isolated separately from the supernatant culture \nmedium. FIM are extracted and copurified from the bacterial cells. The pertussis antigens are \npurified by sequential filtration, salt-precipitation, ultrafiltration and chromatography. PT is \ndetoxified with glutaraldehyde, FHA is treated with formaldehyde, and the residual aldehydes \nare removed by ultrafiltration. The individual antigens are adsorbed onto aluminum phosphate. \nThe tetanus toxin is produced from Clostridium tetani grown in modified Mueller-Miller \ncasamino acid medium without beef heart infusion. (3) Tetanus toxin is detoxified with \nformaldehyde and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and diafiltration. \nCorynebacterium diphtheriae is grown in modified Mueller’s growth medium. (4) After \npurification by ammonium sulfate fractionation, diphtheria toxin is detoxified with formaldehyde \nand diafiltered. \n \n14 \nThe adsorbed diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis components are combined with \naluminum phosphate (as adjuvant), 2-phenoxyethanol (not as a preservative) and water for \ninjection. Adacel does not contain a preservative. \nIn the guinea pig potency test, the tetanus component induces at least 2 neutralizing units/mL of \nserum and the diphtheria component induces at least 0.5 neutralizing units/mL of serum. The \npotency of the acellular pertussis vaccine components is evaluated by the antibody response of \nimmunized mice to detoxified PT, FHA, PRN and FIM as measured by enzyme-linked \nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA). \nDiphtheria and tetanus toxoids are individually adsorbed onto aluminum phosphate. \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 Mechanism of Action  \nTetanus \nTetanus is a disease manifested primarily by neuromuscular dysfunction caused by a potent \nexotoxin released by C tetani. \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to tetanus toxin. A \nserum tetanus antitoxin level of at least 0.01 IU/mL, measured by neutralization assay is \nconsidered the minimum protective level. (5) (6) \nDiphtheria \nDiphtheria is an acute toxin-mediated disease caused by toxigenic strains of C diphtheriae. \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to diphtheria \ntoxin. A serum diphtheria antitoxin level of 0.01 IU/mL is the lowest level giving some degree of \nprotection. Antitoxin levels of at least 0.1 IU/mL are generally regarded as protective. (5) Levels \nof 1.0 IU/mL have been associated with long-term protection. (7) \nPertussis \nPertussis (whooping cough) is a respiratory disease caused by B pertussis. This Gram-negative \ncoccobacillus produces a variety of biologically active components, though their role in either \nthe pathogenesis of, or immunity to, pertussis has not been clearly defined. \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nAdacel has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or impairment of male \nfertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \nThe effectiveness of the tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid used in Adacel was based on the \nimmune response to these antigens compared to a US licensed Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids \nAdsorbed For Adult Use (Td) vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc., Swiftwater, PA. The \nprimary measures for immune response to the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids were the percentage \nof participants attaining an antibody level of at least 0.1 IU/mL. \n \n15 \nThe effectiveness of the pertussis antigens used in Adacel was evaluated based on a comparison \nof pertussis antibody levels achieved in recipients of Adacel with those obtained in infants after \nthree or four doses of DAPTACEL. For the first dose of Adacel, the comparisons were to infants \nwho received three doses of DAPTACEL in the Sweden I Efficacy trial. For the second dose of \nAdacel, for the evaluation of FHA, PRN, and FIM antibody levels, the comparisons were to \ninfants who received three doses of DAPTACEL in the Sweden I Efficacy trial; for evaluation of \nPT antibody levels, the comparison was to infants who received four doses of DAPTACEL in a \nUS safety and immunogenicity study (Study NCT00255047). In the Sweden I Efficacy Trial, \nthree doses of DAPTACEL vaccine were shown to confer a protective efficacy of 84.9% (95% \nCI: 80.1%, 88.6%) against WHO defined pertussis (21 days of paroxysmal cough with \nlaboratory-confirmed B pertussis infection or epidemiological link to a confirmed case). The \nprotective efficacy against mild pertussis (defined as at least one day of cough with laboratory-\nconfirmed B pertussis infection) was 77.9% (95% CI: 72.6%, 82.2%). (8) \nIn addition, the ability of Adacel to elicit a booster response (defined as rise in antibody \nconcentration after vaccination) to the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis antigens following \nvaccination was evaluated. \n14.1 Immunological Evaluation in Adolescents and Adults, 11 through 64 Years \nof Age Following a First Vaccination with Adacel (Td506) \nStudy Td506 was a comparative, multi-center, randomized, observer-blind, controlled trial which \nenrolled 4,480 participants; 2,053 adolescents (11-17 years of age) and 2,427 adults (18-64 years \nof age). Enrollment was stratified by age to ensure adequate representation across the entire age \nrange. Participants had not received a tetanus or diphtheria toxoid containing vaccine within the \nprevious 5 years. After enrollment participants were randomized to receive one dose of either \nAdacel or Td vaccine. A total of 4,461 randomized participants were vaccinated. The per-\nprotocol immunogenicity subset included 1,270 Adacel recipients and 1,026 Td vaccine \nrecipients. Sera were obtained before and approximately 35 days after vaccination. [Blinding \nprocedures for safety assessments are described in ADVERSE REACTIONS (6).] \nDemographic characteristics were similar within age groups and between the vaccine groups. A \ntotal of 76% of the adolescents and 1.1% of the adults reported a history of receiving 5 previous \ndoses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccines. Anti-tetanus and anti-diphtheria \nseroprotection rates (≥0.1 IU/mL) and booster response rates were comparable between Adacel \nand Td vaccines. (See Table 4 and Table 5.) Adacel induced pertussis antibody levels that were \nnon-inferior to those of Swedish infants who received three doses of DAPTACEL vaccine \n(Sweden I Efficacy Study). (See Table 6.) Acceptable booster responses to each of the pertussis \nantigens were also demonstrated, i.e., the percentage of participants with a booster response \nexceeded the predefined lower limit.

This matched case-control study included pertussis cases \nreported from 2011 through 2014 in infants born at ≥ 37 weeks gestation and ≥ 2 days old. A \ncase of pertussis was defined as the onset of cough illness and at least one of the following: \nlaboratory-confirmation (culture or PCR) of pertussis, epidemiological linkage to a laboratory-\nconfirmed case, or clinically-compatible illness (cough ≥2 weeks with paroxysms, inspiratory \nwhoop or post-tussive vomiting) in an infant <2 months old.  NCT05040802 included a total of \n596 infants (179 cases of pertussis and 417 controls without pertussis), the mean age was 4.2 \n(SD, 2.5) weeks, and 45.7% were non-Hispanic. For the vaccine effectiveness re-analysis, a \nconditional logistic regression model controlling for infant’s age and maternal education, was fit \nto data from 101 cases (including 5 infants whose mothers received Adacel during the third \ntrimester and ≥14 days before delivery) and 171 controls (including 27 infants whose mothers \nreceived Adacel during the third trimester and ≥14 days before delivery) matched by birth \nhospital. This resulted in a vaccine effectiveness estimate of 88.0% (95% CI: 43.8, 97.4) for \nvaccination during the third trimester and ≥14 days before delivery.  \n14.4 \nImmune Responses to Pertussis Vaccination in Infants Born to Mothers Who \nReceived Adacel During Pregnancy  \nPublished studies have reported diminished immune responses to pertussis antigens in DTaP-\ncontaining vaccines administered to infants whose mothers received Adacel during the third \ntrimester of pregnancy compared with infants whose mothers did not receive Adacel during the \nthird trimester of pregnancy (10, 11). Whether the diminished immune responses observed in \nvaccinated infants whose mothers received Adacel during pregnancy result in diminished \neffectiveness of pertussis vaccination in infants is unknown.  \n14.5 Concomitant Hepatitis B Vaccine Administration  \nThe concomitant use of Adacel (first vaccination) and hepatitis B (Hep B) vaccine (Recombivax \nHB®, 10 mcg per dose using a two-dose regimen, manufactured by Merck and Co., Inc.) was \nevaluated in a multi-center, open-labeled, randomized, controlled study that enrolled 410 \nadolescents, 11 through 14 years of age inclusive. One group received Adacel and Hep B \nvaccines concurrently (N = 206). The other group (N = 204) received Adacel at the first visit, \nthen 4-6 weeks later received Hep B vaccine. The second dose of Hep B vaccine was given 4-6 \nweeks after the first dose. Serum samples were obtained prior to and 4-6 weeks after Adacel \nadministration, as well as 4-6 weeks after the 2nd dose of Hep B for all participants. No \ninterference was observed in the immune responses to any of the vaccine antigens when Adacel \nand Hep B vaccines were given concurrently or separately. [See ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1).] \n14.6 Concomitant Influenza Vaccine Administration  \nThe concomitant use of Adacel (first vaccination) and trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine \n(TIV, Fluzone®, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc., Swiftwater, PA) was evaluated in a multi-\ncenter, open-labeled, randomized, controlled study conducted in 720 adults, 19-64 years of age \ninclusive. In one group, participants received Adacel and TIV vaccines concurrently (N = 359). \nThe other group received TIV at the first visit, then 4-6 weeks later received Adacel (N = 361). \n \n22 \nSera were obtained prior to and 4-6 weeks after Adacel, as well as 4-6 weeks after the TIV. The \nimmune responses were comparable for concurrent and separate administration of Adacel and \nTIV vaccines for diphtheria (percent of participants with seroprotective concentration ≥0.10 \nIU/mL and booster responses), tetanus (percent of participants with seroprotective concentration \n≥0.10 IU/mL), pertussis antigens (booster responses and GMCs except lower PRN GMC in the \nconcomitant group, lower bound of the 90% CI was 0.61 and the prespecified criterion was \n≥0.67) and influenza antigens (percent of participants with hemagglutination-inhibition [HI] \nantibody titer ≥1:40 IU/mL and ≥4-fold rise in HI titer). Although tetanus booster response rates \nwere significantly lower in the group receiving the vaccines concurrently versus separately, \ngreater than 98% of participants in both groups achieved seroprotective levels of ≥0.1 IU/mL. \n[See ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1).] \n15 \nREFERENCES  \n1 Stratton KR, et al, editors.

The organism is grown in a semi-\nsynthetic medium. Casein derived raw materials are used early in manufacturing during the \nfermentation process. The capsular polysaccharide is precipitated from the concentrated culture \nsupernatant by the addition of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and the product is purified \nby differential centrifugation and precipitation. Each 0.5 mL dose may contain residual amounts \nof formaldehyde (not more than 100 mcg) used for the inactivation of the bacterial culture. The \npotency of the purified polysaccharide is assessed by molecular size and O-acetyl content. \nPhenol, 0.25%, is added as a preservative. The vaccine contains residual polydimethylsiloxane or \nfatty-acid ester-based antifoam. The vaccine is a clear, colorless solution. Each dose of 0.5 mL is \nformulated to contain 25 mcg of purified Vi polysaccharide in a colorless isotonic phosphate \nbuffered saline (pH 7 ± 0.3), 4.150 mg of Sodium Chloride, 0.065 mg of Disodium Phosphate, \n0.023 mg of Monosodium Phosphate, and 0.5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. The vial stopper \nand the plunger stopper of the syringe are not made with natural rubber latex.  \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \nTyphoid fever is an infectious disease caused by S typhi. Humans are the only natural host and \nreservoir for S typhi; infections result from the consumption of food or water that has been \ncontaminated by the excretions of an acute case or a carrier. S typhi organisms efficiently invade \nthe human intestinal mucosae ultimately leading to bacteremia; following a typical 10- to 14-day \nincubation period, a systemic illness occurs. The clinical presentation of typhoid fever exhibits a \nbroad range of severity and can be debilitating. Classical cases have fever, myalgia, anorexia, \nabdominal discomfort and headaches; the fever increases step-wise over a period of days and \nthen may remain at 102°F to 106°F over 10 to 14 days before decreasing in a step-wise manner. \nSkin lesions known as rose spots may be present. Constipation is common in older children and \nadults, while diarrhea may occur in younger children. Among the less common but most severe \ncomplications are intestinal perforation and hemorrhage, and death. The course is typically more \nsevere without appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The case fatality rate was reported to be \napproximately 10% to 20% in the pre-antibiotic era. (1) (2) (3) During the period of 1983 to 1991 \nin the US, the case fatality rate reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \nwas 0.2% (9/4010). (4) Infection of the gallbladder can lead to the chronic carrier state. \nTyphoid fever is still endemic in many countries of the world where it is predominantly a disease \nof school-age children and may be a major public health problem. Most cases of typhoid fever in \n \n \n \n2 \n \nthe US are thought to be acquired during foreign travel. During the periods of 1975 to 1984 and \n1983 to 1984, respectively, 62% and 70% of the cases of typhoid fever reported to the CDC were \nacquired during foreign travel; this compares to 33% of cases during 1967-1972. (5) \nIn 1992, 414 cases of typhoid fever were reported to the CDC. Of these 414 cases, 1 (0.2%) case \noccurred in an infant under one year of age; 77 (18.6%) cases occurred in persons one to nine \nyears of age; 81 (19.6%) cases occurred in persons 10 to 19 years of age; 251 (60.6%) cases \noccurred in individuals ≥20 years of age; the age was not available for 4 (1%) cases. One death \nwas reported in 1991. (4) Domestic surveillance could underestimate the risk of typhoid fever in \ntravelers since the disease is unlikely to be reported for persons who received diagnosis and \ntreatment overseas. (6)  \nApproximately 2% to 4% of acute typhoid fever cases develop into a chronic carrier state. The \nchronic carrier state occurs more frequently with advanced age, and among females than males. \n(2) (7) These non-symptomatic carriers are the natural reservoir for S typhi and can serve to \nmaintain the disease in its endemic state or to directly infect new individuals. Outbreaks of \ntyphoid fever are often traced to food handlers who are asymptomatic carriers. (8) \nTwo formulations were utilized in studies of the Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine. These \nincluded the liquid formulation which is identical to Typhim Vi vaccine and a lyophilized \nformulation. \nThe protective efficacy of each of these formulations of the Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine \nwas assessed independently in two trials conducted in areas where typhoid fever is endemic. A \nsingle intramuscular dose of 25 mcg was used in these efficacy studies. A randomized double-\nblind controlled trial with Typhim Vi vaccine (liquid formulation) was conducted in five villages \nwest of Katmandu, Nepal. There were 6,908 vaccinated subjects: 3,454 received Typhim Vi \nvaccine and 3,454 in the control group received a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide \nvaccine. Of the 6,908 subjects, 6,439 subjects were in the target population of 5 to 44 years of \nage. In addition, 165 children ages 2 to 4 years and 304 adults over 44 years of age were included \nin the study. The overall protective efficacy of Typhim Vi vaccine was 74% (95% confidence \ninterval (CI): 49% to 87%) for blood culture confirmed cases of typhoid fever during 20 months \nof post-vaccination follow-up. (9) (10) (11) \nThe protective efficacy of the Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine, lyophilized formulation, was \nevaluated in a randomized double-blind controlled trial conducted in South Africa. There were \n11,384 vaccinated children 5 to 15 years of age; 5,692 children received the Vi capsular \npolysaccharide vaccine and 5,692 in the control group received Meningococcal Polysaccharide \n(Groups A+C) Vaccine. The protective efficacy for the Vi capsular polysaccharide (lyophilized \nformulation) group for blood culture confirmed cases of typhoid fever was 55% (95% CI: 30% to \n70%) overall during 3 years of post-vaccination follow-up, and was 61%, 52% and 50%, \nrespectively, for years 1, 2, and 3. Vaccination was associated with an increase in anti-Vi \nantibodies as measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. \nAntibody levels remained elevated at 6 and 12 months post-vaccination. (11) (12) \n \n \n \n3 \n \nBecause of the low incidence of typhoid fever, efficacy studies were not feasible in a US \npopulation. \nControlled comparative efficacy studies of Typhim Vi vaccine and other types of typhoid \nvaccines have not been performed.  \nAn increase in serum anti-capsular antibodies is thought to be the basis of protection provided by \nTyphim Vi vaccine. However, a specific correlation of post-vaccination antibody levels with \nsubsequent protection is not available, and the level of Vi antibody that will provide protection \nhas not been determined. Also, limitations exist for comparing immunogenicity results from \nsubjects in endemic areas, where some subjects have baseline serological evidence of prior S \ntyphi exposure, to naive populations such as most American travelers. \nIn endemic regions (Nepal, South Africa, Indonesia) where trials were conducted, pre-\nvaccination geometric mean antibody levels suggest that infection with S typhi had previously \noccurred in a large percentage of the vaccinees. In these populations, specific antibody levels \nincreased four-fold or greater in 68% to 87.5% of older children and adult subjects following \nvaccination. For 43 persons 15 to 44 years of age in the Nepal pilot study, geometric mean \nspecific antibody levels pre- and 3 weeks post-vaccination were, respectively, 0.38 and 3.68 mcg \nantibody/mL by RIA; 79% had a four-fold or greater rise in Vi antibody levels. (9) (12) \nImmunogenicity and safety trials were conducted in an adult US population. A single dose of \nTyphim Vi vaccine induced a four-fold or greater increase in antibody levels in 88% and 96% of \nthis adult population for 2 studies, respectively, following vaccination (see Table 1). (10) (13) \nTable 1 (10) (13): Vi ANTIBODY LEVELS IN US ADULTS 18 TO 40 YEARS OF AGE \nGIVEN TYPHIM Vi VACCINE  \n \n \nGEOMETRIC MEAN \nANTIBODY LEVELS (mcg \nantibody/mL by RIA) \n \n \n \nN \nPre \n \nPost (4 \nweeks) \n% ≥4 FOLD \nINCREASE \n \n \n(95% CI) \n(95% CI) \n(95% CI) \nTrial 1 \n(1 lot) \n54 \n0.16 \n(0.13 to 0.21) \n3.23 \n(2.59 to 4.03) 96% (52/54) \n(87% to 100%) \nTrial 2 \n(2 lots \ncombined) \n97 \n0.17 \n(0.14 to 0.21) \n2.86 \n(2.26 to 3.62) 88% (85/97) \n(81% to 94%) \nNo studies of safety and immunogenicity have been conducted in US children. A double-blind \nrandomized controlled trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of Typhim Vi vaccine was \nperformed in 175 Indonesian children. The percentage of 2- to 5-year-old children achieving a \nfour-fold or greater increase in antibody levels at 4 weeks post-vaccination was 96.3% (52/54) \n \n \n \n4 \n \n(95% CI: 87.3% to 99.6%), and in the study subset of 2-year-old children was 94.4% (17/18) \n(95% CI: 72.7% to 99.9%). The geometric mean antibody levels (mcg antibody/mL by RIA) for \nthe 2-to 5-year-old children and the subset of 2-year-olds were, respectively, 5.81 (4.36 to 7.77) \nand 5.76 (3.48 to 9.53). (10) (11) \nIn the US Reimmunization Study, adults previously immunized with Typhim Vi vaccine in other \nstudies were reimmunized with a 25 mcg dose at 27 or 34 months after the primary dose. Data on \nantibody response to primary immunization, decline following primary immunization, and \nresponse to reimmunization are presented in Table 2. Antibody levels attained following \nreimmunization at 27 or 34 months after the primary dose were similar to levels attained \nfollowing the primary immunization. (10) (13) This response is typical for a T-cell independent \npolysaccharide vaccine in that reimmunization does not elicit higher antibody levels than primary \nimmunization. The safety of reimmunization was also evaluated in this study (see ADVERSE \nREACTIONS section). \nTable 2 (10) (13): US STUDIES IN 18- TO 40-YEAR-OLD ADULTS: KINETICS AND \nPERSISTENCE OF Vi ANTIBODY* RESPONSE TO PRIMARY IMMUNIZATION \nWITH TYPHIM Vi VACCINE, AND RESPONSE TO REIMMUNIZATION AT 27 OR 34 \nMONTHS  \n \nPRE-\nDOSE 1 \n1  \nMONTH \n11 \nMONTHS \n18 \nMONTHS \n27 \nMONTHS \n34 \nMONTHS \n1 MONTH POST-\nREIMMUNIZATION# \nGROUP 1† \n \n \n \nND§ \n \nND \n \nN \n43 \n43 \n39 \n \n43 \n \n43 \nLevel* \n0.19 \n3.01 \n1.97 \n \n1.07¶ \n \n3.04 \n95% CI \n(0.14-0.26) \n(2.22-4.06) \n(1.31-3.00) \n \n(0.71-1.62) \n \n(2.17-4.26) \nGROUP 2‡ \n \n \nND \n \nND \n \n \nN \n12 \n12 \n \n10 \n \n12 \n12 \nLevel \n0.14 \n3.78 \n \n1.21 \n \n0.76¶ \n3.31 \n95% CI \n(0.11-0.18) \n(2.18-6.56) \n \n(0.63-2.35) \n \n(0.37-1.55) \n(1.61-6.77) \n* mcg antibody/mL by RIA \n† Group 1: Reimmunized at 27 months following primary immunization. \n‡ Group 2: Reimmunized at 34 months following primary immunization. \n§ Not Done. \n¶ Antibody levels pre-reimmunization. \n# Includes available data from all reimmunized subjects (subjects initially randomized to Typhim Vi vaccine, and \nsubjects initially randomized to placebo who received open label Typhim Vi vaccine two weeks later). \nConcurrently Administered Vaccines  \nConcomitant Administration of Typhim Vi and Menactra®, Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and \nW-135) Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine, Manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur \nSA  \nIn a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial, 945 participants aged 18 through 55 years \nreceived Typhim Vi and Menactra vaccines concomitantly (N=469), or Typhim Vi vaccine \n \n \n \n5 \n \nfollowed one month later by Menactra vaccine (N=476). Sera were obtained approximately 28 \ndays after each respective vaccination. The antibody response to Typhim Vi vaccine and to \nMenactra vaccine components were similar between groups.  \nINDICATIONS AND USAGE  \nTyphim Vi vaccine is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of typhoid fever \ncaused by S typhi and is approved for use in persons two years of age or older.  \nImmunization with Typhim Vi vaccine should occur at least two weeks prior to expected \nexposure to S typhi.  \nTyphim Vi vaccine is not indicated for routine immunization of individuals in the United States \n(US). (14) \nSelective immunization against typhoid fever is recommended under the following \ncircumstances: 1) travelers to areas where a recognized risk of exposure to typhoid exists, \nparticularly ones who will have prolonged exposure to potentially contaminated food and water, \n2) persons with intimate exposure (ie, continued household contact) to a documented typhoid \ncarrier, and 3) workers in microbiology laboratories who frequently work with S typhi. (14) \nTyphoid vaccination is not required for international travel, but is recommended for travelers to \nsuch areas as Africa, Asia, and Central and South America where there is a recognized risk of \nexposure to S typhi. Current CDC advisories should be consulted with regard to specific locales. \nVaccination is particularly recommended for travelers who will have prolonged exposure to \npotentially contaminated food and water. However, even travelers who have been vaccinated \nshould use caution in selecting food and water. (15) \nThere is no evidence to support the use of typhoid vaccine to control common source outbreaks, \ndisease following natural disaster or in persons attending rural summer camps. (14) \nAn optimal reimmunization schedule has not been established. Reimmunization every two years \nunder conditions of repeated or continued exposure to the S typhi organism is recommended at \nthis time.  \nFor recommended primary immunization and reimmunization see DOSAGE AND \nADMINISTRATION section. \nTyphim Vi vaccine should not be used to treat a patient with typhoid fever or a chronic typhoid \ncarrier. \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \nTyphim Vi vaccine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any \ncomponent of this vaccine.  \n \n \n \n6 \n \nWARNINGS  \nAllergic reactions have been reported rarely in the post-marketing experience (see ADVERSE \nREACTIONS section). \nThe safety and immunogenicity of Typhim Vi vaccine in children under two years of age has not \nbeen established. As with other polysaccharide vaccines, the antibody response may be \ninadequate. The decision whether to vaccinate children under 2 years of age depends upon the \nrisk incurred by the child on the basis of the epidemiological context. \nTyphim Vi vaccine provides protection against the risk of infection related to Salmonella typhi, \nbut gives no protection against Salmonella paratyphi A or B, non-S typhi species of Salmonella \nenterica serovar Typhi, or other bacteria that cause enteric disease. \nIf the vaccine is used in persons deficient in producing antibodies, whether due to genetic defect, \nimmunodeficiency disease, or immunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may \nnot be obtained. This includes patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV-infection, severe \ncombined immunodeficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia, or agammaglobulinemia; altered \nimmune states due to diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy; or an \nimmune system compromised by treatment with corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites \nor radiation. (16) \nAs with any vaccine, vaccination with Typhim Vi vaccine may not protect 100% of individuals. \nPRECAUTIONS  \nGeneral  \nCare is to be taken by the health-care provider for the safe and effective use of Typhim Vi \nvaccine. \nEpinephrine injection (1:1000) must be immediately available following immunization  should an \nanaphylactic or other allergic reaction occur due to any component of the vaccine.  \nPrior to an injection of any vaccine, all known precautions should be taken to prevent adverse \nreactions. This includes a review of the patient's history with respect to possible hypersensitivity \nto the vaccine or similar vaccines. \nAcute infection or febrile illness may be reason for delaying use of Typhim Vi vaccine except \nwhen, in the opinion of the physician, withholding the vaccine entails a greater risk. \nSyncope (fainting) has been reported following vaccination with Typhim Vi. Procedures should \nbe in place to prevent falling injury and manage syncopal reactions. \n \n \n \n7 \n \nSafety and immunogenicity data from controlled trials are not available for Typhim Vi vaccine \nfollowing previous immunization with whole-cell typhoid or live, oral typhoid vaccine (see \nADVERSE REACTIONS section). \nInformation for Vaccine Recipients or Parents/Guardians  \nBefore administration, healthcare providers should inform patients, parents or guardians of the \nbenefits and risks of immunization with Typhim Vi vaccine.  \nPrior to administration of Typhim Vi vaccine, healthcare providers should ask patients, parents \nand guardians about the recent health status of the patient to be immunized. \nTyphim Vi vaccine is indicated in persons traveling to endemic or epidemic areas. Current CDC \nadvisories should be consulted with regard to specific locales. \nTravelers should take all necessary precautions to avoid contact with or ingestion of \ncontaminated food and water.  \nOne dose of vaccine should be given at least 2 weeks prior to expected exposure. \nReimmunization consisting of a single-dose for US travelers every two years under conditions of \nrepeated or continued exposure to the S typhi organism is recommended at this time. (14) \nAs part of the child's or adult's immunization record, the date, lot number, and manufacturer of \nthe vaccine administered should be recorded. (17) \nDrug Interactions  \nConcomitant Vaccine Administration \nTyphim Vi was concomitantly administered with Menactra vaccine in individuals 18 through 55 \nyears of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and ADVERSE REACTIONS).  \nNo studies have been conducted in the US to evaluate interactions or immunological interference \nbetween the concurrent use of Typhim Vi vaccine and drugs (including antibiotics and \nantimalarial drugs), immune globulins or other vaccines (including common travelers vaccines \nsuch as tetanus, poliomyelitis, hepatitis A, and yellow fever).  \nTyphim Vi vaccine must not be mixed with any vaccine in the same syringe. Separate injection \nsites should be used in case of concomitant administration. \nCARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY  \nTyphim Vi vaccine has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or \nimpairment of fertility. \n \n \n \n8 \n \nPREGNANCY  \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Typhim Vi vaccine. It is not known \nwhether Typhim Vi vaccine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can \naffect reproduction capacity. Typhim Vi vaccine should be given to a pregnant woman only if \nclearly needed. (14) \nWhen possible, delaying vaccination until the second or third trimester to minimize the \npossibility of teratogenicity is a reasonable precaution. (18) \nNURSING MOTHERS  \nIt is not known whether Typhim Vi vaccine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are \nexcreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Typhim Vi vaccine is administered to \na nursing woman. \nThere is no data on the use of this product in nursing mothers.  \nPEDIATRIC USE  \nSafety and effectiveness of Typhim Vi vaccine have been established in children 2 years of age \nand older. (10) (11) (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.)  \nFor children below the age of 2 years, safety and effectiveness have not been established. \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \nAdverse event information is derived from clinical trials and worldwide post-marketing \nexperience. \nData From Clinical Trials  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction \ninformation from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events \nthat appear to be related to vaccine use and for approximating rates. \nSafety of Typhim Vi vaccine, the US licensed liquid formulation, has been assessed in clinical \ntrials in more than 4,000 subjects both in countries of high and low endemicity. In addition, the \nsafety of the lyophilized formulation has been assessed in more than 6,000 individuals. The \nadverse reactions were predominately minor and transient local reactions. Local reactions such as \ninjection site pain, erythema, and induration almost always resolved within 48 hours of \nvaccination. Elevated oral temperature, above 38°C (100.4°F), was observed in approximately \n \n \n \n9 \n \n1% of vaccinees in all studies. No serious or life-threatening systemic events were reported in \nthese clinical trials. (10) (11) \nAdverse reactions from two trials evaluating Typhim Vi vaccine lots in the US (18- to 40-year-\nold adults) are summarized in Table 3. No severe or unusual side effects were observed. Most \nsubjects reported pain and/or tenderness (pain upon direct pressure). Local adverse experiences \nwere generally limited to the first 48 hours.

Fever ≥40.0°C and seizures were not reported. \nData From Worldwide Post-marketing Experience  \nIn addition to reports in clinical trials, worldwide voluntary adverse events reports received since \nmarket introduction of Typhim Vi vaccine are listed below. This list includes serious events \nand/or events which were included based on severity, frequency of reporting or a plausible causal \nconnection to Typhim Vi vaccine. Because these events were reported voluntarily from a \npopulation of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a \ncausal relationship to vaccination. \n• \nGastrointestinal disorders \nNausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain \n• \nGeneral disorders and administration site condition \nInjection site pain, inflammation, induration, and erythema; lymphadenopathy, fever, \nasthenia, malaise, flu-like episode \n• \nImmune system disorders \nAnaphylaxis, allergic-type reactions such as pruritus, rash, urticaria, angioedema, \ndifficulty breathing, hypotension; serum sickness \n• \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nMyalgia, arthralgia, cervical pain \n• \nNervous system disorders \nSyncope with and without convulsions, headache, loss of consciousness, tremor \n• \nRespiratory system disorders \n• \nAsthma \nAdditional Adverse Events: \nPost-marketing reports of glomerulonephritis, neutropenia, bilateral retinitis, and polyarthritis \nhave been reported in patients who had also received other vaccines; however, a causal \nrelationship has not been established. \n \n \n \n12 \n \nReporting of Adverse Events  \nReporting by parents and patients of all adverse events occurring after vaccine administration \nshould be encouraged. Adverse events following immunization with vaccine should be reported \nby the health-care provider to the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) \nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Reporting forms and information about \nreporting requirements or completion of the form can be obtained from VAERS through a toll-\nfree number 1-800-822-7967 or visit the VAERS website at http//www.vaers.org. (17) \nHealth-care providers also should report these events to the Pharmocovigilance Department, \nSanofi Pasteur Inc., Discovery Drive, Swiftwater, PA 18370, or call 1-800-822-2463. \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  \nFor intramuscular use only.  \nDosage  \nThe immunizing dose for adults and children is a single injection of 0.5 mL.  \nA reimmunizing dose is 0.5 mL. Reimmunization consisting of a single dose for US travelers \nevery two years under conditions of repeated or continued exposure to the S typhi organism is \nrecommended at this time. (14) \nPreparation for Administration  \nThe syringe or vial and its packaging should be inspected prior to use for evidence of leakage, \npremature activation of the plunger, or a faulty tip seal. If any of these conditions exists, do NOT \nadminister the vaccine. \n• Syringe \nPicture A: Luer-Lok™ syringe \n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \nStep 1: Holding the syringe cap in one \nhand (avoid holding the syringe plunger \nor barrel), unscrew the tip cap by twisting \nit counterclockwise. \n \nStep 2: To attach the needle to the \nsyringe, gently twist the needle clockwise \ninto the syringe until slight resistance is \nfelt.  \n \nThe syringe is intended for single use only, must not be reused, and must be disposed of properly \nand promptly following its use.  \n• Vial  \nTear off upper seal of vial cap. Cleanse top of rubber stopper of the vial with a suitable antiseptic. \nUse a separate sterile syringe and needle or a sterile disposable unit for each individual patient to \nprevent the transmission of infectious agents from person to person.  Needles should not be \nrecapped and should be properly disposed. \nAdministration  \nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration \nprior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If any of this conditions exists, \ndo NOT administer the vaccine. \nIn adults, the intramuscular injection is typically given in the deltoid. In children, the \nintramuscular injection is given either in the deltoid or the anterolateral thigh. \nDo NOT inject this vaccine into the gluteal area or areas where there may be a nerve trunk.  \nDo NOT inject intravenously. \n \n \n \n14 \n \nHOW SUPPLIED  \nSingle-dose syringe, without needle, 0.5 mL, NDC 49281-790-88.

See full prescribing information for \nDAPTACEL. \nDAPTACEL (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis \nVaccine Adsorbed)  \nSuspension for Intramuscular Injection \nInitial U.S. Approval: 2002 \n----------------------------RECENT MAJOR CHANGES ------------------------ \nDosage and Administration (2.1) \nxx/202x \n----------------------------INDICATIONS AND USAGE--------------------------- \n▪ \nDAPTACEL is a vaccine indicated for active immunization against \ndiphtheria, tetanus and pertussis as a five-dose series in infants and \nchildren 6 weeks through 6 years of age (prior to 7th birthday). (1) \n----------------------DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION----------------------- \n▪ \nThe five dose immunization series consists of a 0.5 mL intramuscular \ninjection administered at 2, 4, 6 and 15-20 months of age, and at 4-6 years \nof age. (2.1, 2.2) \n---------------------DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS---------------------- \n▪ Suspension for injection, supplied in single-dose (0.5 mL) vials (3)  \n---------------------------CONTRAINDICATIONS---------------------------------- \n▪ Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any \ndiphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, or pertussis-containing vaccine, or any \ncomponent of DAPTACEL. (4.1) \n▪ Encephalopathy within 7 days of a previous pertussis-containing vaccine \nwith no other identifiable cause. (4.2) \n▪ Progressive neurologic disorder until a treatment regimen has been \nestablished and the condition has stabilized. (4.3) \n-----------------------WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS------------------------ \n▪ \nCarefully consider benefits and risks before administering DAPTACEL to \npersons with a history of: \n- fever ≥40.5°C (105°F), hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (HHE) \nor persistent, inconsolable crying lasting ≥3 hours within 48 hours \nafter a previous pertussis-containing vaccine. (5.2) \n- seizures within 3 days after a previous pertussis-containing \nvaccine. (5.2) \n▪ \nIf Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior \nvaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome \nmay be increased following DAPTACEL. (5.3) \n▪ \nFor infants and children with a history of previous seizures, an antipyretic \nmay be administered (in the dosage recommended in its prescribing \ninformation) at the time of vaccination with DAPTACEL and for the \nnext 24 hours. (5.4)  \n▪ \nApnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some \ninfants born prematurely. The decision about when to administer an \nintramuscular vaccine, including DAPTACEL, to an infant born \nprematurely should be based on consideration of the individual infant’s \nmedical status and the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. \n(5.7) \n------------------------------ADVERSE REACTIONS------------------------------- \n▪ Rates of adverse reactions varied by dose number, with systemic reactions \nmost frequent following doses 1-3 and injection site reactions most \nfrequent following doses 4 and 5. Systemic reactions that occurred in \n>50% of subjects following any dose included fussiness/irritability, \ninconsolable crying, and decreased activity/lethargy. Fever ≥38.0°C \noccurred in 6-16% of US subjects, depending on dose number. Injection \nsite reactions that occurred in >30% of subjects following any dose \nincluded tenderness, redness and increase in arm circumference.

The first dose may be given as early as \n6 weeks of age. Four doses of DAPTACEL constitute a primary immunization course for \npertussis. The fifth dose is a booster for pertussis immunization. Three doses of DAPTACEL \nconstitute a primary immunization course for diphtheria and tetanus. The fourth and fifth doses \nare boosters for diphtheria and tetanus immunization. [See Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.3).]  \nMixed Sequences of DAPTACEL and other DTaP-containing Vaccines \nDAPTACEL contains the same pertussis antigens, manufactured by the same process, as \nPentacel® [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Inactivated \nPoliovirus and Haemophilus b Conjugate (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate) vaccine] and VAXELIS \n(Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis, Inactivated Poliovirus, Haemophilus b \nConjugate and Hepatitis B Vaccine). Pentacel and VAXELIS contain twice the amount of \ndetoxified pertussis toxin (PT) and four times the amount of filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) as \nDAPTACEL. \nDAPTACEL may be used as any of the doses in a 5-dose DTaP series initiated with Pentacel or \nVAXELIS. \nData are not available on the safety and effectiveness of using mixed sequences of DAPTACEL \nand DTaP-containing vaccines from different manufacturers for successive doses of the DTaP \nvaccination series.  \n \n2.2 \nAdministration \nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration \nprior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exist, \nthe product should not be administered.  \nJust before use, shake the vial well, until a uniform, white, cloudy suspension results.  \nWithdraw and administer a single 0.5 mL dose of DAPTACEL intramuscularly. Discard unused \nportion. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each injection. Changing needles between \nwithdrawing the vaccine from the vial and injecting it into a recipient is not necessary unless the \nneedle has been damaged or contaminated. In infants younger than 1 year, the anterolateral aspect \nof the thigh provides the largest muscle and is the preferred site of injection. In older children, the \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n \n3 \ndeltoid muscle is usually large enough for injection. The vaccine should not be injected into the \ngluteal area or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk.  \nDo not administer this product intravenously or subcutaneously. \nDAPTACEL should not be combined through reconstitution or mixed with any other vaccine. \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \nDAPTACEL is a suspension for injection in 0.5 mL single-dose vials. See Description (0) for a \ncomplete listing of ingredients. \n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \n4.1 \nHypersensitivity \nA severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of DAPTACEL or any other \ntetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, or pertussis-containing vaccine, or any other component of this \nvaccine is a contraindication to administration of DAPTACEL. [See Description (0).] Because of \nuncertainty as to which component of the vaccine may be responsible, none of the components \nshould be administered. Alternatively, such individuals may be referred to an allergist for \nevaluation if further immunizations are to be considered. \n4.2 \nEncephalopathy \nEncephalopathy (e.g., coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) within 7 days \nof a previous dose of a pertussis containing vaccine that is not attributable to another identifiable \ncause is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing vaccine, including \nDAPTACEL.  \n4.3 \nProgressive Neurologic Disorder \nProgressive neurologic disorder, including infantile spasms, uncontrolled epilepsy, or progressive \nencephalopathy is a contraindication to administration of any pertussis-containing vaccine, \nincluding DAPTACEL. Pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with such \nconditions until a treatment regimen has been established and the condition has stabilized.  \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n5.1 \nManagement of Acute Allergic Reactions \nEpinephrine hydrochloride solution (1:1,000) and other appropriate agents and equipment must be \navailable for immediate use in case an anaphylactic or acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs. \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n \n4 \n5.2 \nAdverse Reactions Following Prior Pertussis Vaccination \nIf any of the following events occur within the specified period after administration of a \nwhole-cell pertussis vaccine or a vaccine containing an acellular pertussis component, the \ndecision to administer DAPTACEL should be based on careful consideration of potential benefits \nand possible risks. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1).] \n• Temperature of 40.5°C (105°F) within 48 hours, not attributable to another identifiable \ncause. \n• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode [HHE]) within 48 hours. \n• Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours within 48 hours. \n• Seizures with or without fever within 3 days. \n5.3 \nGuillain-Barré Syndrome and Brachial Neuritis \nA review by the Institute of Medicine found evidence for a causal relation between tetanus toxoid \nand both brachial neuritis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. (1) If Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred \nwithin 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the risk for Guillain-Barré \nsyndrome may be increased following DAPTACEL.  \n5.4 \nInfants and Children with a History of Previous Seizures \nFor infants or children with a history of previous seizures, an appropriate antipyretic may be \nadministered (in the dosage recommended in its prescribing information) at the time of \nvaccination with a vaccine containing an acellular pertussis component (including DAPTACEL) \nand for the following 24 hours, to reduce the possibility of post-vaccination fever.  \n5.5 \nLimitations of Vaccine Effectiveness \nVaccination with DAPTACEL may not protect all individuals. \n5.6 \nAltered Immunocompetence \nIf DAPTACEL is administered to immunocompromised persons, including persons receiving \nimmunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained. [See \nImmunosuppressive Treatments (7.2).] \n5.7 \nApnea in Premature Infants \nApnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. \nThe decision about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including DAPTACEL, to an \ninfant born prematurely should be based on consideration of the individual infant’s medical status \nand the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. \n5.8 \nSyncope \nSyncope (fainting) has been reported following vaccination with DAPTACEL. Procedures should \nbe in place to avoid injury from fainting.  \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n \n5 \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS \n6.1 \nData from Clinical Studies \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials \nof another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction \ninformation from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events \nthat appear to be related to vaccine use and for approximating rates of those events. \nApproximately 18,000 doses of DAPTACEL have been administered to infants and children in 9 \nclinical studies. Of these, 3 doses of DAPTACEL were administered to 4,998 children, 4 doses of \nDAPTACEL were administered to 1,725 children, and 5 doses of DAPTACEL were administered \nto 485 children. A total of 989 children received 1 dose of DAPTACEL following 4 prior doses of \nPentacel. \nIn a randomized, double-blinded pertussis vaccine efficacy trial, the Sweden I Efficacy Trial, \nconducted in Sweden during 1992-1995, the safety of DAPTACEL was compared with DT and a \nwhole-cell pertussis DTP vaccine. A standard diary card was kept for 14 days after each dose and \nfollow-up telephone calls were made 1 and 14 days after each injection. Telephone calls were \nmade monthly to monitor the occurrence of severe events and/or hospitalizations for the 2 months \nafter the last injection. There were fewer of the solicited common local and systemic reactions \nfollowing DAPTACEL than following the whole-cell pertussis DTP vaccine. As shown in Table \n1, the 2,587 infants who received DAPTACEL at 2, 4 and 6 months of age had similar rates of \nreactions within 24 hours as recipients of DT and significantly lower rates than infants receiving \nwhole-cell pertussis DTP. \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n6 \nTable 1:  Percentage of Infants from Sweden I Efficacy Trial with Local or Systemic \nReactions within 24 Hours Post-Dose 1, 2 and 3 of DAPTACEL compared with DT \nand Whole-Cell Pertussis DTP Vaccines  \nEvent \nDose 1 \n(2 MONTHS) \nDAPTACEL \nN = 2,587 \nDose1 (2 \nMONTHS) \nDT \nN = 2,574 \nDose 1 \n(2 \nMONTH\nS) DTP \nN = \n2,102 \nDose 2 \n(4 \nMONTH\nS) \nDAPTAC\nEL \nN = \n2,563 \nDose 2 \n(4 \nMONTH\nS) DT \nN = \n2,555 \nDose 2 \n(4 \nMONTHS)\nDTP \nN = 2,040 \nDose 3 \n(6 \nMONTHS) \nDAPTACEL \nN = 2,549 \nDose 3 \n(6 \nMONTHS\n) DT \nN = 2,538 \nDose 3 \n(6 \nMONTHS) \nDTP \nN = 2,001 \nLocal \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTenderness \n (Any) \n8.0* \n8.4 \n59.5 \n10.1* 10.3 \n60.2 \n10.8* \n10.0 \n50.0 \nRedness \n \n2 cm  \n0.3* \n0.3 \n6.0 \n1.0* \n0.8 \n5.1 \n3.7* \n2.4 \n6.4 \nSwelling \n \n2 cm  \n0.9* \n0.7 \n10.6 \n1.6* \n2.0 \n10.0 \n6.3*† \n3.9 \n10.5 \nSystemic  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFever‡ \n38°C \n(100.4°F) \n7.8* \n7.6 \n72.3 \n19.1* 18.4 \n74.3 \n23.6* \n22.1 \n65.1 \nFretfulness§ \n32.3 \n33.0 \n82.1 \n39.6 39.8 \n85.4 \n35.9 \n37.7 \n73.0 \nAnorexia \n11.2* \n10.3 \n39.2 \n9.1* \n8.1 \n25.6 \n8.4* \n7.7 \n17.5 \nDrowsiness \n32.7* \n32.0 \n56.9 \n25.9* 25.6 \n50.6 \n18.9* \n20.6 \n37.6 \nCrying \n1 hour \n1.7* \n1.6 \n11.8 \n2.5* \n2.7 \n9.3 \n1.2* \n1.0 \n3.3 \nVomiting \n6.9* \n6.3 \n9.5 \n5.2¶  \n5.8 \n7.4 \n4.3 \n5.2 \n5.5 \nDT: Swedish National Biologics Laboratories \nDTP: whole-cell pertussis DTP, Sanofi Pasteur Inc. \nN = Number of evaluable subjects \n* \np<0.001: DAPTACEL versus whole-cell pertussis DTP \n†  \np<0.0001: DAPTACEL versus DT \n‡  \nRectal temperature  \n§  \nStatistical comparisons were not made for this variable \n¶ \np<0.003: DAPTACEL versus whole-cell pertussis DTP \nThe incidence of serious and less common selected systemic events in the Sweden I Efficacy Trial \nis summarized in \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n7 \nTable 2.  \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n8 \nTable 2:  Selected Systemic Events: Rates Per 1,000 Doses after Vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 \nMonths of Age in Sweden I Efficacy Trial \nEVENT \nDose 1 (2 \nMONTHS) \nDAPTAC\nEL \nN = 2,587 \nDose 1 (2 \nMONTHS) \nDT \nN = 2,574 \nDose 1 (2 \nMONTHS) \nDTP \nN = 2,102 \nDose 1 (4 \nMONTHS) \nDAPTAC\nEL \nN = 2,565 \nDose 1 \n(4 \nMONTHS) \nDT \nN = 2556 \nDose 1 \n(4 \nMONTHS) \nDTP \nN = 2,040 \nDose 3 \n(6 \nMONTHS) \nDAPTAC\nEL \nN = 2,551 \n \nDose 3 \n(6 \nMONTHS) \nDT \nN = 2,539 \nDose 3 \n(6 \nMONTHS) \nDTP \nN = 2,002 \nRectal \ntemperature \n40°C \n(104°F) \nwithin 48 \nhours of \nvaccination \n0.39 \n0.78 \n3.33 \n0 \n0.78 \n3.43 \n0.39 \n1.18 \n6.99 \nHypotonic-\nhypo-\nresponsive \nepisode \nwithin 24 \nhours of \nvaccination \n0 \n0 \n1.9 \n0 \n0 \n0.49 \n0.39 \n0 \n0 \nPersistent \ncrying 3 \nhours within \n24 hours of \nvaccination \n1.16 \n0 \n8.09 \n0.39 \n0.39 \n1.96 \n0 \n0 \n1.0 \nSeizures \nwithin 72 \nhours of \nvaccination \n0 \n0.39 \n0 \n0 \n0.39 \n0.49 \n0 \n0.39 \n0 \nDT: Swedish National Biologics Laboratories \nDTP: whole-cell pertussis DTP, Sanofi Pasteur Inc. \nN = Number of evaluable subjects \nIn the Sweden I Efficacy Trial, one case of whole limb swelling and generalized symptoms, with \nresolution within 24 hours, was observed following dose 2 of DAPTACEL. No episodes of \nanaphylaxis or encephalopathy were observed. No seizures were reported within 3 days of \nvaccination with DAPTACEL. Over the entire study period, 6 seizures were reported in the \nDAPTACEL group, 9 in the DT group and 3 in the whole-cell pertussis DTP group, for overall \nrates of 2.3, 3.5 and 1.4 per 1,000 vaccinees, respectively. One case of infantile spasms was \nreported in the DAPTACEL group. There were no instances of invasive bacterial infection or \ndeath.\nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n9 \nIn a US study, children received 4 doses of DAPTACEL at 2, 4, 6 and 15-17 months of age. A \ntotal of 1,454 children received DAPTACEL and were included in the safety analyses. Of these, \n51.7% were female, 77.2% Caucasian, 6.3% Black, 6.5% Hispanic, 0.9% Asian and 9.1% other \nraces. The use of DAPTACEL as a fifth dose of DTaP vaccine was evaluated in 2 subsequent US \nclinical studies. In one study, a total of 485 children received DAPTACEL at 4-6 years of age \nfollowing 4 prior doses of DAPTACEL in infancy (DAPTACEL-primed). In a separate study, a \ntotal of 989 children received DAPTACEL at 4-6 years of age following 4 prior doses of Pentacel \nin infancy (Pentacel-primed). The children included in these fifth dose studies were non-random \nsubsets of participants from previous DAPTACEL or Pentacel studies. The subsets were \nrepresentative of all children who received 4 doses of DAPTACEL or Pentacel in the earlier \nstudies with regard to frequencies of solicited local and systemic adverse events following the \nfourth dose.  \nIn the US 4-dose DAPTACEL study, at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, DAPTACEL was administered \nconcomitantly with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid \nconjugate) (Sanofi Pasteur SA), inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) (Sanofi Pasteur SA), and \n7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.). Infants had received the \nfirst dose of hepatitis B vaccine at 0 months of age. At 2 and 6 months of age, hepatitis B vaccine \n(recombinant) (Merck & Co., Inc.) was also administered concomitantly with DAPTACEL. Based \non random assignment, the fourth dose of DAPTACEL was administered either alone; \nconcomitantly with Hib conjugate (tetanus toxoid conjugate) vaccine; or concomitantly with Hib \nconjugate (tetanus toxoid conjugate) vaccine, 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, measles, \nmumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine (Merck & Co., Inc.), and varicella vaccine (Merck & Co., Inc.). \nIn the fifth dose studies, DAPTACEL was administered concomitantly with IPV (all \nDAPTACEL-primed subjects and 47% of Pentacel-primed subjects) and MMR vaccine. \nIn the US studies, the occurrence of solicited local and systemic adverse events listed in Table 3 \nwas recorded daily by parents or guardians for Days 0-7 following vaccination. For Days 0 and 1 \nfollowing the first three doses of DAPTACEL, signs and symptoms of HHE also were solicited. \nPeriodic telephone calls were made to inquire about adverse events. Serious adverse events were \nmonitored during the three studies, through 6 months following the last dose of DAPTACEL. \nThe incidence and severity of selected solicited local and systemic adverse events that occurred \nwithin 3 days following each dose of DAPTACEL are shown in Table 3. The incidence of \nredness, tenderness and swelling at the DAPTACEL injection site increased with the fourth and \nfifth doses, with the highest rates reported after the fifth dose. The incidence of redness, \ntenderness and swelling at the DAPTACEL injection site was similarly increased when \nDAPTACEL was given as a fifth dose of DTaP vaccine in Pentacel-primed children.\nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n10 \nTable 3:  Number (Percentage) of Children from US Studies with Selected Solicited Local \nand Systemic Adverse Events by Severity Occurring Between 0 to 3 Days after \nEach Dose of DAPTACEL \n \nDose 1* \nN = 1390-1406 \n% \nDose 2* \nN = 1346-1360 \n% \nDose 3* \nN = 1301-1312 \n% \nDose 4* \nN = 1118-1144 \n% \nDose 5 \nDAPTACEL- \nprimed* \nN = 473-481  \n% \nDose 5 \nPentacel-\nprimed* \nN = 936-981 \n% \nInjection Site Reactions \n(DAPTACEL injection \nsite) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRedness  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n>5 mm \n6.2 \n7.1 \n9.6 \n17.3 \n35.8 \n20.2 \n \n25 - 50 mm \n0.6 \n0.5 \n1.9 \n6.3 \n10.4 \n6.8 \n \n>50 mm \n0.4 \n0.1 \n0.0 \n3.1 \n15.8 \n6.6 \nSwelling  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n>5 mm \n4.0 \n4.0 \n6.5 \n11.7 \n23.9 \n12.0 \n \n25 - 50 mm \n1.2 \n0.6 \n1.0 \n3.2 \n5.8 \n4.1 \n \n>50 mm \n0.4 \n0.1 \n0.1 \n1.6 \n7.7 \n2.9 \nTenderness† \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAny \n48.8 \n38.2 \n40.9 \n49.5 \n61.5 \n50.0 \n \nModerate  \n16.5 \n9.9 \n10.6 \n12.3 \n11.2 \n7.4 \n \nSevere \n4.1 \n2.3 \n1.7 \n2.2 \n1.7 \n0.3 \nIncrease in Arm \nCircumference‡ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n>5 mm \n- \n- \n- \n30.1 \n38.3 \n28.6 \n \n20 - 40 mm \n- \n- \n- \n7.0 \n14.0 \n7.6 \n \n>40 mm \n- \n- \n- \n0.4 \n1.5 \n1.2 \nInterference with \nNormal Activity of the \nArm§ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAny \n- \n- \n- \n- \n20.4 \n8.8 \n \nModerate \n- \n- \n- \n- \n5.6 \n1.7 \n \nSevere \n- \n- \n- \n- \n0.4 \n0.0 \nSystemic Reactions \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFever¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n≥38.0°C \n9.3 \n16.1 \n15.8 \n10.5 \n6.1 \n4.6 \n \n>38.5-39.5°C \n1.5 \n3.9 \n4.8 \n2.7 \n2.1 \n2.0 \n \n>39.5°C \n0.1 \n0.4 \n0.3 \n0.7 \n0.2 \n0.2 \nDecreased \nActivity/Lethargy# \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAny \n51.1 \n37.4 \n33.2 \n25.3 \n21.0 \n12.6 \n \nModerate  \n23.0 \n14.4 \n12.1 \n8.2 \n5.8 \n3.6 \n \nSevere \n1.2 \n1.4 \n0.6 \n1.0 \n0.8 \n0.4 \nInconsolable CryingÞ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAny \n58.5 \n51.4 \n47.9 \n37.1 \n14.1 \n7.2 \n \nModerate \n14.2 \n12.6 \n10.8 \n7.7 \n3.5 \n1.9 \n \nSevere \n2.2 \n3.4 \n1.4 \n1.5 \n0.4 \n0.3 \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n11 \n \nDose 1* \nN = 1390-1406 \n% \nDose 2* \nN = 1346-1360 \n% \nDose 3* \nN = 1301-1312 \n% \nDose 4* \nN = 1118-1144 \n% \nDose 5 \nDAPTACEL- \nprimed* \nN = 473-481  \n% \nDose 5 \nPentacel-\nprimed* \nN = 936-981 \n% \nFussiness/Irritabilityβ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAny \n75.8 \n70.7 \n67.1 \n54.4 \n34.9 \n22.9 \n \nModerate \n27.7 \n25.0 \n22.0 \n16.3 \n7.5 \n5.3 \n \nSevere \n5.6 \n5.5 \n4.3 \n3.9 \n0.4 \n0.5 \n*  In one US study, children received four doses of DAPTACEL.

One seizure occurred within 7 days post-vaccination: an infant who \nexperienced an afebrile seizure with apnea on the day of the first vaccination. Three other cases \nof seizures occurred between 8 and 30 days post-vaccination. Of the seizures that occurred \nwithin 60 days post-vaccination, 3 were associated with fever. In this study, there were no \nreported cases of HHE following DAPTACEL. There was one death due to aspiration 222 days \npost-vaccination in a subject with ependymoma. Within 30 days following any dose of \nDAPTACEL, 57 (3.9%) subjects reported at least one serious adverse event. During this period, \nthe most frequently reported serious adverse event was bronchiolitis, reported in 28 (1.9%) \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n12 \nsubjects. Other serious adverse events that occurred within 30 days following DAPTACEL \ninclude three cases of pneumonia, two cases of meningitis and one case each of sepsis, pertussis \n(post-dose 1), irritability and unresponsiveness. \nIn the US study in which DAPTACEL was administered as a fifth DTaP dose in DAPTACEL-\nprimed subjects, within 30 days following the fifth consecutive dose of DAPTACEL, 1 (0.2%) \nsubject reported 2 serious adverse events (bronchospasm and hypoxia). In the US study in which \nDAPTACEL was administered as a fifth DTaP dose in Pentacel-primed subjects, within 30 days \nfollowing DAPTACEL, 4 (0.4%) subjects reported one or more serious adverse events (asthma \nand pneumonia; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; vomiting; cellulitis not at the injection \nsite). In these two studies, there were no reports of seizures within 30 days following \nDAPTACEL in either the DAPTACEL-primed subjects or Pentacel-primed subjects. \nIn another study (Sweden II Efficacy Trial), 3 DTaP vaccines and a whole-cell pertussis DTP \nvaccine, none of which are licensed in the US, were evaluated to assess relative safety and \nefficacy. This study included HCPDT, a vaccine made of the same components as DAPTACEL \nbut containing twice the amount of detoxified PT and four times the amount of FHA (20 mcg \ndetoxified PT and 20 mcg FHA). HHE was observed following 29 (0.047%) of 61,220 doses of \nHCPDT; 16 (0.026%) of 61,219 doses of an acellular pertussis vaccine made by another \nmanufacturer; and 34 (0.056%) of 60,792 doses of a whole-cell pertussis DTP vaccine. There \nwere 4 additional cases of HHE in other studies using HCPDT vaccine for an overall rate of \n33 (0.047%) in 69,525 doses. \nIn a randomized, parallel-group, US multi-center clinical trial conducted in children 4 through 6 \nyears of age, DAPTACEL was administered as follows: concomitantly with IPV (Sanofi Pasteur \nSA) followed 30 days later by Menactra® [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) \nPolysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur Inc.] [Group A]; \nconcomitantly with Menactra followed 30 days later by IPV [Group B]; or 30 days after \nconcomitant administration of Menactra and IPV [Group C]. Solicited injection site and systemic \nreactions were recorded in a diary card for 7 consecutive days after each vaccination. For all \nstudy groups, the most frequently reported solicited local reaction at the DAPTACEL injection \nsite was pain: 71.7%, 69.4% and 52.1% of subjects in Groups A, B and C, respectively. For all \nstudy groups, the most frequently reported systemic reaction after DAPTACEL vaccination was \nmyalgia: 46.2%, 37.3% and 25.8% of subjects in Groups A, B and C, respectively. Fever \n>39.5ºC occurred at <1.0% in all groups. \n6.2 \nPostmarketing Experience \nThe following adverse events have been spontaneously reported during the postmarketing use of  \nDAPTACEL in the US and other countries. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a \npopulation of uncertain size, it may not be possible to reliably estimate their frequency or \nestablish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. \nThe following adverse events were included based on one or more of the following factors: \nseverity, frequency of reporting, or strength of evidence for a causal relationship to DAPTACEL. \n• Blood and lymphatic disorders \nLymphadenopathy \n• Cardiac disorders \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n13 \nCyanosis \n• Gastro-intestinal disorders \nNausea, diarrhea \n• General disorders and administration site conditions \nLocal reactions: injection site pain, injection site rash, injection site nodule, injection site \nmass, extensive swelling of injected limb (including swelling that involves adjacent \njoints). \n• Infections and infestations \nInjection site cellulitis, cellulitis, injection site abscess \n• Immune system disorders \nHypersensitivity, allergic reaction, anaphylactic reaction (edema, face edema, swelling \nface, pruritus, rash generalized) and other types of rash (erythematous, macular, maculo-\npapular) \n• Nervous system disorders \nConvulsions: febrile convulsion, grand mal convulsion, partial seizures  \nHHE, hypotonia, somnolence, syncope \n• Psychiatric disorders \nScreaming  \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS \n7.1 \nConcomitant Administration with Other Vaccines \nIn clinical trials, DAPTACEL was administered concomitantly with one or more of the following \nUS licensed vaccines: Hib conjugate vaccine, IPV, hepatitis B vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate \nvaccine, Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid \nConjugate vaccine, MMR vaccine, and varicella vaccine. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) and \nClinical Studies (0).] When DAPTACEL is given at the same time as another injectable \nvaccine(s), the vaccines should be administered with different syringes and at different injection \nsites. \nIn cases where DAPTACEL and Menactra are to be administered to children 4 through 6 years \nof age, the two vaccines should be administered concomitantly or Menactra should be \nadministered prior to DAPTACEL. Administration of Menactra one month after DAPTACEL \nhas been shown to reduce meningococcal antibody responses to Menactra. [See Adverse \nReactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (0).] \n7.2 \nImmunosuppressive Treatments \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic \ndrugs and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune \nresponse to DAPTACEL. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n14 \n8.4  \nPediatric Use  \nDAPTACEL is not indicated for use in infants below 6 weeks of age or children 7 years of age \nor older. Safety and effectiveness of DAPTACEL in these age groups have not been established. \n11 \nDESCRIPTION \nDAPTACEL is a sterile isotonic suspension of pertussis antigens and diphtheria and tetanus \ntoxoids adsorbed on aluminum phosphate, for intramuscular injection.  \nEach 0.5 mL dose contains 15 Lf diphtheria toxoid, 5 Lf tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis \nantigens [10 mcg detoxified pertussis toxin (PT), 5 mcg filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), 3 \nmcg pertactin (PRN), and 5 mcg fimbriae types 2 and 3 (FIM)].  \nOther ingredients per 0.5 mL dose include 1.5 mg aluminum phosphate (0.33 mg of aluminum) \nas the adjuvant, ≤5 mcg residual formaldehyde, <50 ng residual glutaraldehyde and 3.3 mg \n(0.6% v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol (not as a preservative).  \nThe acellular pertussis vaccine components are produced from Bordetella pertussis cultures \ngrown in Stainer-Scholte medium (2) modified by the addition of casamino acids and \ndimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin. PT, FHA and PRN are isolated separately from the supernatant \nculture medium. The FIM components are extracted and co-purified from the bacterial cells. The \npertussis antigens are purified by sequential filtration, salt-precipitation, ultrafiltration and \nchromatography. PT is detoxified with glutaraldehyde. FHA is treated with formaldehyde, and \nthe residual aldehydes are removed by ultrafiltration. The individual antigens are adsorbed \nseparately onto aluminum phosphate. \nCorynebacterium diphtheriae is grown in modified Mueller’s growth medium. (3) After \npurification by ammonium sulfate fractionation, diphtheria toxin is detoxified with formaldehyde \nand diafiltered. Clostridium tetani is grown in modified Mueller-Miller casamino acid medium \nwithout beef heart infusion. (4) Tetanus toxin is detoxified with formaldehyde and purified by \nammonium sulfate fractionation and diafiltration. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are individually \nadsorbed onto aluminum phosphate. \nThe adsorbed diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis components are combined with \naluminum phosphate (as adjuvant), 2-phenoxyethanol (not as a preservative) and water for \ninjection.  \nBoth diphtheria and tetanus toxoids induce at least 2 units of antitoxin per mL in the guinea pig \npotency test. The potency of the acellular pertussis vaccine components is determined by the \nantibody response of immunized mice to detoxified PT, FHA, PRN and FIM as measured by \nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). \n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n12.1 Mechanism of Action \nDiphtheria  \nDiphtheria is an acute toxin-mediated disease caused by toxigenic strains of C diphtheriae. \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to diphtheria \ntoxin. A serum diphtheria antitoxin level of 0.01 IU/mL is the lowest level giving some degree of \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n15 \nprotection. Antitoxin levels of at least 0.1 IU/mL are generally regarded as protective. (5) Levels \nof 1.0 IU/mL have been associated with long-term protection. (6) \nTetanus \nTetanus is an acute disease caused by an extremely potent neurotoxin produced by C tetani. \nProtection against disease is due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to tetanus toxin. A \nserum tetanus antitoxin level of at least 0.01 IU/mL, measured by neutralization assay is \nconsidered the minimum protective level. (5) (7) A tetanus antitoxin level ≥0.1 IU/mL as \nmeasured by the ELISA used in clinical studies of DAPTACEL is considered protective. \nPertussis \nPertussis (whooping cough) is a respiratory disease caused by B pertussis. This Gram-negative \ncoccobacillus produces a variety of biologically active components, though their role in either \nthe pathogenesis of, or immunity to, pertussis has not been clearly defined. \n13 \nNON-CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \nDAPTACEL has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of \nfertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES \n14.1 Diphtheria \nIn a US study in which children received 4 doses of DAPTACEL at 2, 4, 6 and 15-17 months of \nage, after the third dose, 100% (N = 1,099) achieved diphtheria antitoxin levels of ≥0.01 IU/mL \nand 98.5% achieved diphtheria antitoxin levels of ≥0.10 IU/mL. Among a random subset of \nchildren who received the fourth dose of DAPTACEL at 15-16 months of age, 96.5% (N = 659) \nachieved diphtheria antitoxin levels of ≥1.0 IU/mL after the fourth dose.  \n14.2 Tetanus \nIn a US study in which children received 4 doses of DAPTACEL at 2, 4, 6 and 15-17 months of \nage, after the third dose, 100% (N = 1,037) achieved tetanus antitoxin levels of ≥0.10 IU/mL. \nAmong a random subset of children who received the fourth dose of DAPTACEL at 15-16 \nmonths of age, 98.8% (N = 681) achieved tetanus antitoxin levels of ≥1.0 IU/mL after the fourth \ndose.  \n14.3 Pertussis \nA randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study was conducted in \nSweden during 1992-1995 (Sweden I Efficacy Trial) under the sponsorship of the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. A total of 9,829 infants received 1 of 4 vaccines: \nDAPTACEL (N = 2,587); another investigational acellular pertussis vaccine (N = 2,566); whole-\ncell pertussis DTP vaccine (N = 2,102); or DT vaccine as placebo (Swedish National \nBacteriological Laboratory, N = 2,574). Infants were immunized at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. \nThe mean length of follow-up was 2 years after the third dose of vaccine. The protective efficacy \nof DAPTACEL against pertussis after 3 doses using the World Health Organization (WHO) case \ndefinition (21 consecutive days of paroxysmal cough with culture or serologic confirmation or \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n16 \nepidemiologic link to a confirmed case) was 84.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 80.1 to 88.6). \nThe protective efficacy of DAPTACEL against mild pertussis (1 day of cough with laboratory \nconfirmation) was 77.9% (95% CI 72.6 to 82.2). Protection against pertussis by DAPTACEL \nwas sustained for the 2-year follow-up period.  \nIn order to assess the antibody response to the pertussis antigens of DAPTACEL in the US \npopulation, 2 lots of DAPTACEL, including the lot used in the Sweden I Efficacy Trial, were \nadministered to US infants in the US Bridging Study. In this study, antibody responses following \n3 doses of DAPTACEL given to US children at 2, 4 and 6 months of age were compared to those \nfrom a subset of the infants enrolled in the Sweden I Efficacy Trial. Assays were performed in \nparallel on the available sera from the US and Swedish infants. Antibody responses to all the \nantigens were similar except for those to the PRN component. For both lots of DAPTACEL, the \ngeometric mean concentration (GMC) and percent response to PRN in US infants (Lot 006, N \n= 107; Lot 009, N = 108) were significantly lower after 3 doses of vaccine than in Swedish \ninfants (N = 83). In separate US and Canadian studies in which children received DAPTACEL at \n2, 4 and 6 months of age, with a fourth dose at either 17-20 months (Canadian study) or 15-16 \nmonths (random subset from US study) of age, antibody responses to each pertussis antigen \nfollowing the fourth dose (Canadian study N = 275; US study N = 237-347) were at least as high \nas those seen in the Swedish infants after 3 doses. While a serologic correlate of protection for \npertussis has not been established, the antibody response to all antigens in North American \ninfants after 4 doses of DAPTACEL at 2, 4, 6 and 15-20 months of age was comparable to that \nachieved in Swedish infants in whom efficacy was demonstrated after 3 doses of DAPTACEL at \n2, 4 and 6 months of age.  \nIn the US Study 005, infants were randomized to receive 3 doses of VAXELIS at 2, 4, and 6 \nmonths of age and DAPTACEL and PedvaxHIB [Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine \n(Meningococcal Protein Conjugate)] at 15 months of age, or Control group vaccines (3 doses of \nPentacel vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age + RECOMBIVAX HB [Hepatitis B Vaccine \n(Recombinant)] at 2 and 6 months of age and DAPTACEL and ActHIB [Haemophilus b \nConjugate Vaccine (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate)] at 15 months of age). All subjects received \nconcomitant Prevnar 13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 \nProtein]) at 2, 4, 6, and 15 months of age. To complete the 4-dose pertussis primary vaccination \nseries, participants in both groups received DAPTACEL at 15 months of age and were evaluated \nfor immune responses to pertussis antigens one month later. \nThe non-inferiority criteria for vaccine response rates and GMCs for all pertussis antigens were \nmet following the fourth dose. (8) \n14.4 Concomitantly Administered Vaccines \nIn the US Bridging study, DAPTACEL was given concomitantly with Hib conjugate vaccine \n(Sanofi Pasteur SA) according to local practices. Anti-PRP immune response was evaluated in \n261 infants who received 3 doses of Hib conjugate vaccine. One month after the third dose, \n96.9% achieved anti-PRP antibody levels of at least 0.15 mcg/mL and 82.7% achieved antibody \nlevels of at least 1.0 mcg/mL.  \nIn the US study in which infants received DAPTACEL concomitantly with Hib conjugate \n(tetanus toxoid conjugate) vaccine, IPV, 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and hepatitis \nB vaccine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], at 7 months of age, 100.0% of subjects (N = 1,050-\n1,097) had protective neutralizing antibody levels (≥1:8 1/dil) for poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3; and \nSanofi Pasteur \n \nFull Prescribing Information \n253 – DAPTACEL® \n \n \n \n17 \n92.4% (N = 998) achieved anti-hepatitis B surface antigen levels ≥10.0 mIU/mL. Although there \nis no established serologic correlate of protection for any of the pneumococcal serotypes, at \n7 months of age 91.3%-98.9% (N = 1,027-1,029) achieved anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide \nlevels ≥0.5 mcg/mL for serotypes 4, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F and 80.7% (N = 1,027) achieved \nan anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide level ≥0.5 mcg/mL for serotype 6B. The mumps \nseroresponse rate was lower when DAPTACEL was administered concomitantly (86.6%; N = \n307) vs. non-concomitantly (90.1%; N = 312) with the first dose of MMR vaccine [upper limit of \n90% confidence interval for difference in rates (non-concomitant minus concomitant) >5%]. \nThere was no evidence for interference in the immune response to the measles, rubella, and \nvaricella antigens or to the fourth dose of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with \nconcomitant administration of DAPTACEL. \nIn a randomized, parallel-group, US multi-center clinical trial conducted in children 4 through 6 \nyears of age, DAPTACEL was administered as follows: concomitantly with IPV (Sanofi Pasteur \nSA) followed 30 days later by Menactra [Group A]; concomitantly with Menactra followed 30 \ndays later by IPV [Group B]; or 30 days after concomitant administration of Menactra and IPV \n[Group C]. Sera were obtained approximately 30 days after each respective vaccination. When \nDAPTACEL was administered concomitantly with Menactra [Group B], antibody responses to \nPT, FHA and PRN (GMC), tetanus (% participants with antibody concentrations ≥1.0 IU/mL), \nand diphtheria (%participants with antibody concentrations ≥1.0 IU/mL) were non-inferior to \nthose observed when DAPTACEL (and IPV) were administered [Group A]. The anti-FIM GMCs \nwere marginally lower when DAPTACEL and Menactra were administered concomitantly but \nthe clinical significance is unknown because there are no established serological correlates of \nprotection for pertussis. When DAPTACEL (and IPV) were administered 30 days prior to \nMenactra [Group A], significantly lower serum-bactericidal assay-human complement (SBA-H) \nGMTs to all 4 meningococcal serogroups were observed compared to when Menactra (and IPV) \nwere administered 30 days prior to DAPTACEL [Group C]. When DAPTACEL was \nadministered concomitantly with Menactra [Group B], SBA-H GMTs to meningococcal \nserogroups A, C, and W-135 were non-inferior to those observed when Menactra (and IPV) were \nadministered [Group C]. The non-inferiority criterion was marginally missed for meningococcal \nserogroup Y. [See Drug Interactions (7.1).] \n \n15 \nREFERENCES \n1 \nStratton KR, et al. editors.
