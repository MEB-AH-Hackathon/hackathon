Inspect FLUVIRIN® syringes and multidose vials visually for particulate matter and/or discoloration prior to \nadministration [see DESCRIPTION (11)]. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.  \nBetween uses, return the multidose vial to the recommended storage conditions between 2º and 8ºC (36º and 46ºF). Do not freeze. \nDiscard if the vaccine has been frozen.  \nA separate sterile syringe and needle must be used for each injection to prevent transmission of infectious agents from one person to \nanother. Needles should be disposed of properly and not recapped.  \nIt is recommended that small syringes (0.5 mL or 1 mL) should be used to minimize any product loss.  \nFor intramuscular use only. \n2.2 Recommended Dose and Schedule  \nThe dose and schedule for Fluvirin is presented in Table 1.  \nTABLE 1 Fluvirin Dose and Schedule  \nAge \nDose \nSchedule \n4 years through 8 years  \nOne or two doses a, 0.5 mL each  \nIf 2 doses, administer at least 1 month apart  \n9 years and older  \nOne dose, 0.5 mL  \n-  \na 1 or 2 doses depends on vaccination history as per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices annual recommendations on \nprevention and control of influenza with vaccines.  \n“-” indicates information is not applicable  \nIn children, the needle size may range from 7/8 to 1¼ inches, depending on the size of the child's deltoid muscle, and should be of \nsufficient length to penetrate the muscle tissue. The anterolateral thigh can be used, but the needle should be longer, usually 1 inch.  \nIn adults, a needle of ≥1 inch is preferred because needles <1 inch might be of insufficient length to penetrate muscle tissue in certain \nadults. The preferred site for intramuscular injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. The vaccine should not be injected in the \ngluteal region or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk.  \n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nFLUVIRIN®, a sterile suspension for intramuscular injection, is supplied in two presentations:  \n• 0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringe  \n• 5.0 mL multi-dose vial containing 10 doses (each dose is 0.5 mL)  \n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  \n4.1 Hypersensitivity  \nDo not administer FLUVIRIN® to anyone with known history of severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to egg proteins (eggs or \negg products), or to any component of FLUVIRIN®, or who has had a life-threatening reaction to previous influenza vaccinations.  \n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 Guillain-Barré Syndrome  \nIf Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of prior influenza vaccine, the decision to give FLUVIRIN® should \nbe based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks.  \n5.2 Altered Immunocompetence  \nIf FLUVIRIN® is administered to immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the \nexpected immune response may not be obtained.  \n5.3 Preventing and Managing Allergic Reactions  \nPrior to administration of any dose of FLUVIRIN®, the healthcare provider should review the patient's prior immunization history for \npossible adverse events, to determine the existence of any contraindication to immunization with FLUVIRIN® and to allow an \nassessment of benefits and risks. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic \nreactions following administration of the vaccine.  \nThe tip caps of the FLUVIRIN® prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex which may cause allergic reactions in latex \nsensitive individuals.  \n5.4 Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness  \nVaccination with FLUVIRIN® may not protect all individuals.  \n5.5 Syncope  \nSyncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including Fluvirin. Syncope can be \naccompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual disturbance, paresthesia, and tonic-clonic limb movements. Procedures \nshould be in place to avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope by maintaining a supine or \nTrendelenburg position.  \n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS  \n6.1 Overall Adverse Reaction Profile  \nSerious allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been observed in individuals receiving FLUVIRIN® during \npostmarketing surveillance.  \n6.2 Clinical Trial Experience  \nAdverse event information from clinical trials provides a basis for identifying adverse events that appear to be related to vaccine use \nand for approximating the rates of these events. However, because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the \nadverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another \nvaccine, and may not reflect rates observed in clinical practice.  \nAdult and Geriatric Subjects \nSafety data were collected in a total of 2768 adult and geriatric subjects (18 years of age and older) who have received FLUVIRIN® in \n29 clinical studies since 1982.  \nIn 9 clinical studies since 1997, among 1261 recipients of FLUVIRIN®, 745 (59%) were women; 1211 (96%) were White, 23 (2%) \nAsian, 15 (1%) Black and 12 (1%) other; 370 (29%) of subjects were elderly (≥65 years of age). All studies have been conducted in \nthe UK, apart from a study run in the US in 2005-2006 where FLUVIRIN® was used as a comparator for an unlicensed vaccine.  \nAfter vaccination, the subjects were observed for 30 minutes for hypersensitivity or other immediate reactions. Subjects were \ninstructed to complete a diary card for three days following immunization (i.e. Day 1 to 4) to collect local and systemic reactions (see \nTables 2 and 3). All local and systemic adverse events were considered to be at least possibly related to the vaccine. Local and \nsystemic reactions mostly began between day 1 and day 2. The overall adverse events reported in clinical trials since 1998 in at least \n5% of the subjects are summarized in Table 4.  \nAdults (18 to 64 years of age) \nIn adult subjects, solicited local adverse events occurred with similar frequency in all trials. The most common solicited adverse \nevents occurring in the first 96 hours after administration (Tables 2 and 3) were associated with the injection site (such as pain, \nerythema, mass, induration and swelling) but were generally mild/moderate and transient. The most common solicited systemic \nadverse events were headache and myalgia.  \nThe most common overall events in adult subjects (18-64 years of age) were headache, fatigue, injection site reactions (pain, mass, \nerythema, and induration) and malaise (Table 4).  \nGeriatric Subjects (65 years of age and older) \nIn geriatric subjects, solicited local and systemic adverse events occurred less frequently than in adult subjects. The most common \nsolicited local and systemic adverse events were injection site pain, and headache (Tables 2 and 3). All were considered \nmild/moderate and were transient.  \nThe most common overall events in elderly subjects (≥65 years of age) were headache and fatigue.  \nOnly 11 serious adverse events in adult and geriatric subjects (18 years and older) have been reported to date from all the trials \nperformed. These serious adverse events were a minor stroke experienced by a 67 year old subject 14 days after vaccination (1990), \ndeath of an 82 year old subject 35 days after  \nTABLE 2 Solicited Adverse Events in the First 72-96 Hours After Administration of FLUVIRIN® in Adult (18-64 years of age) \nand Geriatric (≥65 years of age) Subjects.  \n \n1998-1999*§ \n1999-2000*§ \n2000-2001*§ \n18-64 yrs \nN = 66 \n≥ 65 yrs \nN = 44 \n18-64 yrs \nN = 76 \n≥ 65 yrs \nN = 34 \n18-64 yrs \nN = 75 \n≥ 65 yrs \nN = 35 \nLocal Adverse Events \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPain  \n16 (24%)  \n4 (9%)  \n16 (21%)  \n-  \n9 (12%)  \n-  \nMass  \n7 (11%)  \n1 (2%)  \n4 (5%)  \n-  \n8 (11%)  \n1 (3%)  \nInflammation  \n5 (8%)  \n2 (5%)  \n6 (8%)  \n-  \n7 (9%)  \n1 (3%)  \nEcchymosis  \n4 (6%)  \n1 (2%)  \n3 (4%)  \n1 (3%)  \n4 (5%)  \n-  \nEdema  \n2 (3%)  \n1 (2%)  \n1 (1%)  \n2 (6%)  \n3 (4%)  \n1 (3%)  \nReaction  \n2 (3%)  \n-  \n2 (3%)  \n-  \n4 (5%)  \n1 (3%)  \nHemorrhage  \n-  \n-  \n1 (1%)  \n-  \n-  \n-  \nSystemic Adverse Events \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHeadache  \n7 (11%)  \n1 (2%)  \n17 (22%)  \n3 (9%)  \n4 (5%)  \n-  \nFatigue  \n3 (5%)  \n2 (5%)  \n4 (5%)  \n1 (3%)  \n3 (4%)  \n-  \nMalaise  \n2 (3%)  \n1 (2%)  \n2 (3%)  \n1 (3%)  \n1 (1%)  \n-  \nMyalgia  \n1 (2%)  \n-  \n2 (3%)  \n-  \n-  \n-  \nFever  \n1 (2%)  \n-  \n1 (1%)  \n-  \n-  \n-  \nArthralgia  \n-  \n1 (2%)  \n-  \n1 (3%)  \n-  \n-  \nSweating  \n-  \n-  \n3 (4%)  \n-  \n1 (1%)  \n1 (3%)  \n \n2001-2002*^ \n2002-2003*^ \n2004-2005*^ \n18-64 yrs \nN = 75 \n≥ 65 yrs \nN = 35 \n18-64 yrs \nN = 107 \n≥ 65 yrs \nN = 88 \n18-64 yrs \nN = 74 \n≥ 65 yrs \nN = 61 \nLocal Adverse Events \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPain  \n12 (16%)  \n1 (3%)  \n14 (13%)  \n7 (8%)  \n15 (20%)  \n9 (15%)  \nMass  \n4 (5%)  \n1 (3%)  \n-  \n-  \n-  \n-  \nEcchymosis  \n2 (3%)  \n-  \n3 (3%)  \n3 (3%)  \n2 (3%)  \n1 (2%)  \nEdema  \n2 (3%)  \n1 (3%)  \n6 (6%)  \n2 (2%)  \n-  \n-  \nErythema  \n5 (7%)  \n-  \n11 (10%)  \n5 (6%)  \n16 (22%)  \n5 (8%)  \nSwelling  \n-  \n-  \n-  \n-  \n11 (15%)  \n4 (7%)  \nReaction  \n-  \n-  \n2 (2%)  \n-  \n-  \n-  \nInduration  \n-  \n-  \n14 (13%)  \n3 (3%)  \n11 (15%)  \n1 (2%)  \nPruritus  \n-  \n-  \n1 (1%)  \n-  \n-  \n-  \nSystemic Adverse Events \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHeadache  \n8 (11%)  \n1 (3%)  \n12 (11%)  \n9 (10%)  \n14 (19%)  \n3 (5%)  \nFatigue  \n1 (1%)  \n1 (3%)  \n-  \n-  \n5 (7%)  \n2 (3%)  \nMalaise  \n3 (4%)  \n-  \n3 (3%)  \n4 (5%)  \n1 (1%)  \n1 (2%)  \nMyalgia  \n3 (4%)  \n-  \n5 (5%)  \n3 (3%)  \n8 (11%)  \n1 (2%)  \nFever  \n-  \n-  \n-  \n1 (1%)  \n-  \n-  \nArthralgia  \n-  \n-  \n2 (2%)  \n-  \n1 (1%)  \n-  \nSweating  \n3 (4%)  \n1 (3%)  \n-  \n2 (2%)  \n-  \n-  \nShivering  \n-  \n-  \n-  \n1 (1%)  \n-  \n-  \nResults reported to the nearest whole percent;

The only reactions recorded were tenderness at the site of vaccination \nin 21% of the participants on day 1, which was still present in 16% on day 2 and 5% on day 3. In one child, the tenderness was also \naccompanied by redness at the site of injection for two days. The reactions were not age-dependent and there was no bias towards the \nyounger children.  \nThree clinical studies were carried out between 1995 and 2004 in a total of 520 pediatric subjects (age range 6 - 47 months). Of these, \n285 healthy subjects plus 41‘at risk'subjects received FLUVIRIN®. No serious adverse events were reported. FLUVIRIN® should only \nbe used for the immunization of persons aged 4 years and over.  \n6.3 Postmarketing Experience  \nThe following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post- approval use of FLUVIRIN®. Because these reactions are \nreported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a \ncausal relationship to vaccine exposure. Adverse events described here are included because: a) they represent reactions which are \nknown to occur following immunizations generally or influenza immunizations specifically; b) they are potentially serious; or c) the \nfrequency of reporting.  \n• Body as a whole: Local injection site reactions (including pain, pain limiting limb movement, redness, swelling, warmth, \necchymosis, induration), hot flashes/flushes; chills; fever; malaise; shivering; fatigue; asthenia; facial edema.  \n• Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions (including throat and/ or mouth edema). In rare cases, hypersensitivity \nreactions have lead to anaphylactic shock and death.  \n• Cardiovascular disorders: Vasculitis (in rare cases with transient renal involvement), presyncope, syncope shortly after \nvaccination.  \n• Digestive disorders: Diarrhea; nausea; vomiting; abdominal pain.  \n• Blood and lymphatic disorders: Local lymphadenopathy; thrombocytopenia (some very rare cases were severe with platelet counts \nless than 5,000 per mm3).  \n• Metabolic and nutritional disorders: Loss of appetite.  \n• Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia; myalgia; myasthenia.  \n• Nervous system disorders: Headache; dizziness; neuralgia; paraesthesia; confusion; febrile convulsions; Guillain-Barré Syndrome; \nmyelitis (including encephalomyelitis and transverse myelitis); neuropathy (including neuritis); paralysis (including Bell's Palsy).  \n• Respiratory disorders: Dyspnea; chest pain; cough; pharyngitis; rhinitis.  \n• Skin and appendages: Stevens-Johnson syndrome; sweating; pruritus; urticaria; rash (including non-specific, maculopapular, and \nvesiculobulbous).  \n• General disorders and administration site conditions: Injection site cellulitis- like reaction (very rare cases of swelling, pain, and \nredness were large and extended to the entire arm)  \n6.4 Other Adverse Reactions Associated with Influenza Vaccination  \nAnaphylaxis has been reported after administration of FLUVIRIN®. Although FLUVIRIN® contains only a limited quantity of egg \nprotein, this protein can induce immediate hypersensitivity reactions among persons who have severe egg allergy. Allergic reactions \ninclude hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, and systemic anaphylaxis [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].  \nThe 1976 swine influenza vaccine was associated with an increased frequency of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Evidence for a \ncausal relation of GBS with subsequent vaccines prepared from other influenza viruses is unclear. If influenza vaccine does pose a \nrisk, it is probably slightly more than 1 additional case/1 million persons vaccinated.  \nNeurological disorders temporally associated with influenza vaccination such as encephalopathy, optic neuritis/neuropathy, partial \nfacial paralysis, and brachial plexus neuropathy have been reported.  \nMicroscopic polyangiitis (vasculitis) has been reported temporally associated with influenza vaccination.  \n7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 Concomitant Administration with Other Vaccines  \nThere are no data to assess the concomitant administration of FLUVIRIN® with other vaccines. If FLUVIRIN® is to be given at the \nsame time as another injectable vaccine(s), the vaccines should always be administered at different injection sites. FLUVIRIN® should \nnot be mixed with any other vaccine in the same syringe or vial.  \n7.2 Concurrent Use with Immunosuppressive Therapies  \nImmunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, and corticosteroids (used in \ngreater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune response to FLUVIRIN®.  \n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.1 Pregnancy  \nPregnancy Category B: A reproductive and developmental toxicity study has been performed in rabbits at a dose level that was \napproximately 15 times the human dose based on body weight. The study revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the \nfetus due to FLUVIRIN®. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal \nreproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this vaccine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly \nneeded.  \nIn a reproductive and developmental toxicity study, the effect of FLUVIRIN® on embryo-fetal and post-natal development was \nevaluated in pregnant rabbits. Animals were administered FLUVIRIN® by intramuscular injection twice prior to gestation, during the \nperiod of organogenesis (gestation day 7) and later in pregnancy (gestation day 20), 0.5 mL/rabbit/occasion (approximately 15-fold \nexcess relative to the projected human dose on a body weight basis). No adverse effects on mating, female fertility, pregnancy, \nembryo-fetal development, or post-natal development were observed. There were no vaccine related fetal malformations or other \nevidence of teratogenicity.  \n8.3 Nursing Mothers  \nIt is not known whether FLUVIRIN® is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be \nexercised when FLUVIRIN® is administered to a nursing woman.  \n8.4 Pediatric Use  \nThe safety and immunogenicity of FLUVIRIN® have not been established in children under 4 years of age. The safety and \nimmunogenicity of FLUVIRIN® have been established in the age group 4 years to 16 years. The use of FLUVIRIN® in these age \ngroups is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of FLUVIRIN® in adults that demonstrate the \nimmunogenicity of FLUVIRIN® [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) and CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].  \n8.5 Geriatric Use  \nSince 1997, of the total number of geriatric subjects (n = 397) in clinical studies of FLUVIRIN®, 29% were 65 years and over, while \n2.1% were 75 years and over. Antibody responses were lower in the geriatric population than in younger subjects. Adverse events \noccurred less frequently in geriatric subjects (≥65 years) than in younger adults. Other reported clinical experience has not identified \ndifferences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. [See ADVERSE REACTION (6) and CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].  \n11 DESCRIPTION  \nFLUVIRIN® is a trivalent, sub-unit (purified surface antigen) influenza virus vaccine prepared from virus propagated in the allantoic \ncavity of embryonated hens' eggs inoculated with a specific type of influenza virus suspension containing neomycin and polymyxin. \nEach of the influenza virus strains is harvested and clarified separately by centrifugation and filtration prior to inactivation with \nbetapropiolactone. The inactivated virus is concentrated and purified by zonal centrifugation. The surface antigens, hemagglutinin and \nneuraminidase, are obtained from the influenza virus particle by further centrifugation in the presence of nonylphenol ethoxylate, a \nprocess which removes most of the internal proteins. The nonylphenol ethoxylate is removed from the surface antigen preparation.  \nFLUVIRIN® is a homogenized, sterile, slightly opalescent suspension in a phosphate buffered saline. FLUVIRIN® has been \nstandardized according to USPHS requirements for the 2017/2018 influenza season and is formulated to contain 45 mcg \nhemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5-mL dose in the recommended ratio of 15 mcg HA of each of the following 3 viruses: \nA/Singapore/GP1908/2015,IVR-180 (an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09- like virus;  \nA/Hong Kong/4801/2014, NYMC X-263B (H3N2) (an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014- like virus);  \nand B/Brisbane/60/2008, wild type (a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus).  \nThe 0.5-mL prefilled syringe presentation is formulated without preservative. However, thimerosal, a mercury derivative used during \nmanufacturing, is removed by subsequent purification steps to a trace amount (≤ 1 mcg mercury per 0.5-mL dose).  \nThe 5-mL multidose vial formulation contains thimerosal, a mercury derivative, added as a preservative. Each 0.5-mL dose from the \nmultidose vial contains 25 mcg mercury.  \nEach dose from the multidose vial or from the prefilled syringe may also contain residual amounts of egg proteins (≤ 1 mcg \novalbumin), polymyxin (≤ 3.75 mcg), neomycin (≤ 2.5 mcg), betapropiolactone (not more than 0.5 mcg) and nonylphenol ethoxylate \n(not more than 0.015% w/v).  \nThe tip caps of the FLUVIRIN® prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex. The multidose vial stopper and the syringe \nstopper/plunger do not contain latex.  \n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 Mechanism of Action  \nInfluenza illness and its complications follow infection with influenza viruses. Global surveillance of influenza identifies yearly \nantigenic variants. For example, since 1977, antigenic variants of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses and influenza B viruses have \nbeen in global circulation. Specific levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers post-vaccination with inactivated \ninfluenza virus vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza illness. In some human studies, antibody titer of ≥1:40 \nhave been associated with protection from influenza illness in up to 50% of subjects [see REFERENCES (15.1, 15.2)].  \nAntibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one \nantigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent \ndevelopment of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual \nchange of one or more new strains in each year's influenza vaccine. Therefore, inactivated influenza vaccines are standardized to \ncontain the hemagglutinin of strains (i.e., typically two type A and one type B), representing the influenza viruses likely to be \ncirculating in the United States in the upcoming winter.  \nAnnual revaccination with the current vaccine is recommended because immunity declines during the year after vaccination, and \nbecause circulating strains of influenza virus change from year to year [see REFERENCES (15.3)].  \n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nFLUVIRIN® has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility.  \n14 CLINICAL STUDIES  \nBetween 1982 and 1991, twelve clinical studies were conducted in healthy adult and geriatric subjects and one in children between 4 \nand 12 years of age who were considered to be ‘at risk'. Since 1991 an annual clinical study has been conducted in the UK in healthy \nadults aged 18 years or older. FLUVIRIN® was also used as a control in a US clinical trial in adults (18-49 years of age). In all the \ntrials, blood samples were taken prior to vaccination and approximately three weeks after vaccination to assess the immunogenic \nresponse to vaccination by measurement of anti-HA antibodies. Three clinical studies were carried out between 1995 and 2004 in a \ntotal of 520 pediatric subjects (age range 6-47 months). Of these, 285 healthy subjects plus 41 ‘at risk' pediatric subjects received \nFLUVIRIN®. FLUVIRIN® should only be used for the immunization of persons aged 4 years and over.  \nTABLE 5 Summary of the Seroconversion and Proportion of Subjects Achieving an HI titer ≥1:40 for Adult Subjects  \nYear/Strain \nNo. of subjects \nSeroconversion∞ \nHI titer ≥1:40¥ \nN \n% \n95% CIφ \nn \n% \n95% CIφ \n1998-1999 \nA/H1N1  \n66 \n48  \n73  \n(62, 83)  \n50  \n76  \n(65, 86)  \nA/H3N2  \n43  \n65  \n(54, 77)  \n47  \n71  \n(60, 82)  \nB  \n42  \n64  \n(52, 75)  \n62  \n94  \n(88, 100)  \n1999-2000 \nA/H1N1  \n76 \n45  \n59  \n(48, 70)  \n50  \n66  \n(55, 76)  \nA/H3N2  \n51  \n67  \n(57, 78)  \n66  \n87  \n(79, 94)  \nB  \n53  \n70  \n(59, 80)  \n75  \n99  \n(96, 100)  \n2000-2001 \nA/H1N1  \n74  \n41  \n55  \n(44, 67)  \n41  \n55  \n(44, 67)  \nA/H3N2  \n45  \n61  \n(50, 72)  \n52  \n84  \n(75, 92)  \nB  \n50  \n68  \n(57, 78)  \n73  \n99  \n(96, 100)  \n2001-2002 \nA/H1N1  \n75 \n44  \n59  \n(48, 70)  \n48  \n64  \n(53, 75)  \nA/H3N2  \n46  \n61  \n(50, 72)  \n68  \n91  \n(84, 97)  \nB  \n42  \n56  \n(45, 67)  \n66  \n88  \n(81, 95)  \n2002-2003 \nA/H1N1  \n106 \n62  \n58  \n(49, 68)  \n73  \n69  \n(60, 78)  \nA/H3N2  \n72  \n68  \n(59, 77)  \n93  \n88  \n(81, 94)  \nB  \n78  \n74  \n(65, 82)  \n101  \n95  \n(91, 99)  \n2004-2005 \nA/H1N1  \n74 \n52  \n70  \n(59, 80)  \n66  \n89  \n(80, 95)  \nA/H3N2  \n60  \n81  \n(70, 89)  \n73  \n99  \n(93, 100)  \nB  \n57  \n77  \n(66, 86)  \n69  \n93  \n(85, 98)  \n2005-2006 \nA/H1N1  \n303 \n191  \n63  \n(57, 68)  \n296  \n98  \n(95, 99)  \nA/H3N2  \n273  \n90  \n(86, 93)  \n294  \n97  \n(94, 99)  \nB  \n213  \n70  \n(65, 75)  \n263  \n87  \n(82, 90)  \n∞ Seroconversion: proportion of subjects with either a post-vaccination HI titer ≥1:40 from a pre-vaccination titer <1:10 or at least a \nfour-fold increase from pre-vaccination HI titer ≥1:10 in antibody titer.  \n¥ HI titer ≥1:40: proportion of subjects with a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40.  \nφ 95% CI: 95% confidence interval  \n14.1 Immunogenicity in Adults (18 to 64 years of age)  \nTables 5 and 6 show the immunogenicity data for the adult age group.

The pre-\nspecified efficacy criteria were met in each study, although a relatively lower immunogenicity of A/H1N1 strain was seen in the last \nfour studies (the same strain was in each of the formulations).  \n14.3 Immunogenicity in Pediatric Subjects  \nA small-scale study, was conducted in 1987 to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of FLUVIRIN® in 38 ‘at risk' children, with \ndiabetes and/or asthma, or lymphoid leukemia. Thirty-eight participants aged between 4 and 12 years of age were assessed. Ten \nsubjects had diabetes, 21 had asthma, two had both diabetes and asthma, and one had lymphoid leukemia. There were four healthy \ncontrol subjects. All participants received a single 0.5-mL dose of FLUVIRIN®.  \nImmunogenicity results were obtained for 19 of the 38 subjects enrolled in the study. The point estimate of the percentage of subjects \nachieving a titer of ≥ 1:40 was 84% for the A/H1N1 strain 79% for the B strain, and 53% for the A/H3N2 strain. The GMT fold \nincreases were 5.8 for the A/H1N1 strain, 40 for the B strain and 17.7 for the A/H3N2 strain.  \nThree clinical studies were carried out between 1995 and 2004 in a total of 520  \nTABLE 8 Summary of the Geometric Mean Hemagglutination Inhibition Antibody Titers, Pre- and Post-Immunization, for \nGeriatric Subjects  \nYear/Strain \nNo. of subjects \nGeometric Mean Titer (GMT) \nPre- vaccination \nPost- vaccination \nFold Increase \n(95% CI)* \n1998-1999 \nA/H1N1  \n42  \n13.92  \n176.65  \n12.69  \n(8.24, 19.56)  \nA/H3N2  \n10.69  \n124.92  \n11.69  \n(7.02, 19.46)  \nB  \n114.1  \n273.56  \n2.40  \n(1.82, 3.17)  \n1999-2000 \nA/H1N1  \n34  \n15.82  \n50.58  \n3.20  \n(2.13, 4.80)  \nA/H3N2  \n28.00  \n133.19  \n4.76  \n(2.92, 7.76)  \nB  \n57.16  \n127.86  \n2.24  \n(1.56, 3.20)  \n2000-2001 \nA/H1N1  \n35  \n6.66  \n18.85  \n2.83  \n(1.91, 4.18)  \nA/H3N2  \n25.87  \n140.68  \n5.44  \n(3.72, 7.96)  \nB  \n61.24  \n191.23  \n3.12  \n(2.13, 4.59)  \n2001-2002 \nA/H1N1  \n35  \n12.69  \n26.65  \n2.10  \n(1.55, 2.84)  \nA/H3N2  \n47.33  \n114.26  \n2.41  \n(1.73, 3.38)  \nB  \n45.49  \n91.89  \n2.02  \n(1.47, 2.78)  \n2002-2003 \nA/H1N1  \n89  \n13.29  \n31.92  \n2.40  \n(1.90, 3.03)  \nA/H3N2  \n65.86  \n272.79  \n4.14  \n(3.09, 5.55)  \nB  \n74.87  \n288.57  \n3.85  \n(2.89, 5.13)  \n2004-2005 \nA/H1N1  \n61  \n21  \n64  \n3.13  \n(2.33, 4.2)  \nA/H3N2  \n72  \n320  \n4.43  \n(3.13, 6.27)  \nB  \n20  \n114  \n5.69  \n(4.39, 7.38)  \n* 95% CI: 95% confidence interval  \npediatric subjects (age range 6-47 months). Of these, 285 healthy subjects plus 41 ‘at risk' pediatric subjects, received FLUVIRIN®.  \nIn a 1995/1996 clinical study, 41 subjects (aged 6-36 months) at increased risk for influenza-related complications received two 0.25-\nmL doses of FLUVIRIN®. At least 49% of subjects showed a ≥4-fold increase in HI antibody titer to all three strains. HI antibody \ntiters of 1:40 or greater were seen in at least 71% of the subjects for all three influenza strains, with increases in geometric mean titer \nof 6.0-fold or greater to all three strains.  \nTwo clinical studies (1999-2000 and 2004) indicated a lower immunogenicity profile for FLUVIRIN® compared with two commercial \nsplit vaccines; in a study in the age group 6-47 months the comparator was a US licensed vaccine, Fluzone®, and in another study in \nthe age group 6-36 months the comparator was a non-US licensed inactivated influenza vaccine. Despite the small sample size (a total \nof 285 healthy subjects received FLUVIRIN® in these two clinical studies) the lower immunogenicity profile of FLUVIRIN® was \ngreatest versus the comparator vaccines in children <36months but was also evident in those 36-47 months of age, though the \ndifferences were less.  \nFLUVIRIN® should only be used for the immunization of persons aged 4 years and over.  \n15 REFERENCES  \n15.1 Hannoun C, Megas F, Piercy J.

The reconstituted vaccine should be a clear peach- \nto fuchsia pink-colored suspension. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for \nparticulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container \npermit. If either of these conditions exists, do not administer the vaccine. \n \n3\n \nFigure 1. Hold the \nprefilled syringe by \nthe barrel and unscrew \nthe syringe cap by \ntwisting it \ncounterclockwise. \nAlign the needle to the \naxis of the syringe and \nattach by gently \nconnecting the needle \nhub into the Luer Lock \nAdaptor (LLA) and \nrotate a quarter turn \nclockwise until you \nfeel it lock.  \nFigure 2. Cleanse the \nvial stopper. Transfer \nthe entire contents of \nthe prefilled syringe \ninto the lyophilized \nantigen component \nvial. \nFigure 3. Shake the \nvial well until the \npowder is completely \ndissolved. Do not \ninvert the vial while \nshaking. \nFigure 4. After \nreconstitution, \nwithdraw the entire \ncontents of the \nreconstituted vaccine \ninto the same syringe \nand after changing the \nneedle, administer \nsubcutaneously. \n2.3 \nAdministration  \nAdminister PRIORIX immediately after reconstitution. If not used immediately, store \nrefrigerated between 36° and 46° F (2° and 8°C) and administer within 8 hours. Discard \nreconstituted vaccine if not used within 8 hours.  \n3 \nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \nPRIORIX is a suspension for injection supplied as a single-dose vial of lyophilized antigen \ncomponent to be reconstituted with the accompanying prefilled syringe of sterile water diluent. \nA single dose after reconstitution is approximately 0.5 mL.  \n \n4\n4 \nCONTRAINDICATIONS  \n4.1 \nSevere Allergic Reactions  \nDo not administer PRIORIX to individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions (e.g., \nanaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or after a previous dose of any measles, mumps, \nand rubella virus-containing vaccine [see Description (11)]. \n4.2 \nImmunosuppression  \nDue to the risk of disseminated vaccine virus infection, do not administer PRIORIX to \nindividuals with severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency. \n4.3 \nPregnancy  \nDo not administer PRIORIX to individuals who are pregnant. Pregnancy should be avoided for \n1 month after vaccination [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. \n5 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n5.1 \nAllergic Vaccine Reactions  \nAppropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be available in \nthe event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of PRIORIX. \n5.2 \nFebrile Seizures  \nThere is a risk of febrile seizure following immunization with PRIORIX [see Adverse Reactions \n(6.1)]. \n5.3 \nThrombocytopenia  \nThrombocytopenia and thrombocytopenic purpura have been reported following vaccination \nwith PRIORIX [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. \n5.4 \nSyncope  \nSyncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including \nPRIORIX. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. \n5.5 \nLatex  \nThe tip caps of the prefilled syringes of diluent contain natural rubber latex, which may cause \nallergic reactions. \n5.6 \nRisk of Vaccine Virus Transmission  \nLive attenuated rubella vaccine virus has been detected in the nose and throat of individuals 7 to \n28 days after vaccination with a rubella virus containing vaccine. No documented confirmed \ncases of transmitted rubella vaccine virus have been reported.1 \n \n5\n5.7 \nLimitation of Vaccine Effectiveness  \nVaccination with PRIORIX may not protect all susceptible individuals. \n6 \nADVERSE REACTIONS  \nThe most commonly reported (≥10%) solicited adverse reactions in the following age groups in \nclinical trials were: \n• Age 12 through 15 months – local: pain (26%) and redness (25%); systemic: irritability \n(63%), loss of appetite (45%), drowsiness (45%), and fever (35%) \n• Age 4 through 6 years – local: pain (41%), redness (22%), and swelling (11%); systemic: \nloss of appetite (21%), drowsiness (27%), and fever (24%) \n• Age 7 years and older – local: pain (12%) and redness (12%) \n6.1 \nClinical Trials Experience  \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical \ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \nThe safety of PRIORIX was evaluated in 6 clinical studies, in which a total of 12,151 \nparticipants (6,391 in the United States) received at least 1 dose of PRIORIX: 8,780 children \n(4,148 in the United States) 12 through 15 months of age; 2,917 children (1,950 in the United \nStates) 4 through 6 years of age; and 454 adults and children (293 in the United States) 7 years of \nage and older. Across the 6 studies, participants who received PRIORIX are as follows: 51.6% \nwere male; 64.6% were White, 18.4% were Asian, 6.1% were Black, and 10.9% were of other \nracial groups (including American Indian/Native American, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, \nArabic/North African and Other); and 14.3% were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. The racial/ethnic \ndistribution of participants who received PRIORIX and M-M-R II was similar. \nChildren 12 through 15 Months of Age Who Received PRIORIX as a First Dose \nIn a randomized, observer-blind, controlled clinical study (Study 1, NCT01702428) conducted in \n5 countries (United States [including Puerto Rico], Estonia, Finland, Mexico and Spain), 5,003 \nparticipants 12 through 15 months of age received a first dose of PRIORIX (n = 3,714) or \nM-M-R II (n = 1,289) given concomitantly with HAVRIX (Hepatitis A Vaccine) and VARIVAX \n(Varicella Virus Vaccine Live, Merck & Co., Inc.); children enrolled in the United States also \nreceived PREVNAR 13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine, Pfizer Inc.) \nconcomitantly. In the overall population, 51.3% were male; 75.6% were White, 4.8% were \nBlack, 3.5% were Asian, 16.1% were of other racial groups (including American Indian/Native \nAmerican, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Arabic/North African and Other); and 18.6% were \nof Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. The median age of participants was 12 months (range: 11 to 16 \nmonths). Local solicited adverse reactions were recorded by parents or guardians using \nstandardized diary cards for 4 days. Systemic solicited adverse reactions of drowsiness, loss of \n \n6\nappetite, and irritability were collected for 15 days, and fever, rash, parotid/salivary gland \nswelling, febrile convulsions, and signs of meningeal irritation (i.e., neck stiffness with or \nwithout photophobia or headache) were collected for 43 days (Table 1). Unsolicited adverse \nevents that occurred within 43 days following vaccination were recorded using diary cards \nsupplemented by medical review. Data on solicited adverse reactions and unsolicited adverse \nevents were transcribed into the study database during an on-site visit on Day 42 and via \ntelephone contact on Day 180. \nTable 1.

The first dose was given concomitantly with HAVRIX and VARIVAX; children enrolled \nin the United States (including Puerto Rico) also received PREVNAR 13 concomitantly. In the \noverall population, 51.7% were male; 68.4% were White, 24.4% were Asian, 3.2% were Black, \nand 4.0% were of other racial groups (including American Indian/Native American, Native \nHawaiian/Pacific Islander, Arabic/North African and Other); and 5.6% were of Hispanic/Latino \nethnicity. The median age of participants was 12 months (range: 11 to 16 months). Local \nsolicited adverse reactions were recorded by parents or guardians using standardized diary cards \nfor 4 days, and systemic adverse reactions of fever, rash, parotid/salivary gland swelling, febrile \nconvulsions, and signs of meningeal irritation (i.e., neck stiffness with or without photophobia or \nheadache) were collected for 43 days. Unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 43 days \nfollowing vaccination were recorded using diary cards supplemented by medical review. Data on \nsolicited adverse reactions and unsolicited adverse events were transcribed into the study \ndatabase during on-site visits on Day 42, Day 84, and Day 222. The safety profile of PRIORIX \nfollowing the second dose was similar to the safety profile following the first dose of PRIORIX. \nChildren 4 through 6 Years of Age Who Received PRIORIX as a Second Dose of Measles, \nMumps, and Rubella Vaccine  \nIn a randomized, observer-blind, controlled clinical study (Study 3, NCT01621802) conducted in \n3 countries (United States, South Korea, and Taiwan), 4,007 participants 4 through 6 years of \nage received PRIORIX (n = 2,917) or M-M-R II (n = 1,090) as a second dose following \nadministration of an initial dose of a combined measles, mumps, and rubella virus-containing \nvaccine in the second year of life. PRIORIX and M-M-R II were given concomitantly with \nKINRIX (DTaP-IPV) [Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed and \nInactivated Poliovirus Vaccine] and VARIVAX in a subset of subjects (n = 802 receiving \nPRIORIX, n = 298 receiving M-M-R II) enrolled in the United States. In the overall population, \n52.5% were male; 42.4% were White, 37.2% were Asian, 8.2% were Black, and 12.3% were of \nother racial groups (including American Indian/Native American, Native Hawaiian/Pacific \nIslander, Arabic/North African and Other) and 17.2% were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. The \nmedian age of participants was 4 years (range: 3 to 6 years). In a subset of participants who \nreceived concomitantly administered vaccines, data on local solicited adverse reactions were \nrecorded by parents or guardians using standardized diary cards for 4 days. Systemic solicited \nadverse reactions of drowsiness and loss of appetite were collected for 4 days, and fever, rash, \nparotid/salivary gland swelling, febrile convulsions, and signs of meningeal irritation (i.e., neck \nstiffness with or without photophobia or headache) were collected for 43 days (Table 2). \n \n8\nUnsolicited adverse events that occurred within 43 days following vaccination were recorded \nusing diary cards supplemented by medical review.

Because these reactions are reported \n \n10\nvoluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their \nfrequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccination with PRIORIX. \nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders \nThrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura. \nVascular Disorders \nVasculitis (including Henoch-Schönlein purpura and Kawasaki syndrome). \nImmune system Disorders \nAnaphylactic reactions. \nInfections and Infestations \nMeningitis, measles-like illness, mumps-like illness (including orchitis, epididymitis, and \nparotitis). \nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders \nArthralgia, arthritis. \nNervous System Disorders \nEncephalitis, cerebellitis, cerebellitis-like symptoms (including transient gait disturbance and \ntransient ataxia), Guillain-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, peripheral neuritis, afebrile \nseizures, syncope. \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \nErythema multiforme. \n7 \nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \n7.1 \nImmune Globulins and Blood Products  \nImmune globulins and other blood products administered concomitantly with PRIORIX contain \nantibodies that may interfere with vaccine virus replication and decrease the expected immune \nresponse. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has specific \nrecommendations for intervals between administration of antibody containing products and live \nvirus vaccines. \n7.2 \nTuberculin Skin Testing  \nPRIORIX may result in a temporary suppression of tuberculin reactivity. Therefore, if a \ntuberculin test is to be done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously \nwith, or at least 4 weeks after PRIORIX to avoid false-negative results. \n \n11\n7.3 \nUse With Other Live Viral Vaccines  \nPRIORIX can be administered concomitantly with other live viral vaccines. If not given \nconcomitantly, PRIORIX should be given 1 month before or 1 month after administration of \nother live viral vaccines to avoid potential for immune interference. \n8 \nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \n8.1 \nPregnancy  \nRisk Summary \nPRIORIX contains live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella viruses. The vaccine is \ncontraindicated for use in pregnant women because infection during pregnancy with the \nwild-type viruses is associated with maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. Pregnancy should be \navoided for 1 month after vaccination [see Contraindications (4.3), Patient Counseling \nInformation (17)]. \nReports have indicated that contracting wild-type measles during pregnancy enhances fetal risk, \nincluding increased rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery and congenital \ndefects.2,3 Wild-type mumps virus infection during the first trimester of pregnancy may increase \nthe rate of spontaneous abortion. Pregnant women infected with wild-type rubella virus are at \nincreased risk for miscarriage or stillbirth, and their infants are at risk for congenital rubella \nsyndrome.1 \nAvailable data on inadvertent administration of PRIORIX to pregnant women are insufficient to \ninform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. \nThere are no animal studies with PRIORIX to inform use during pregnancy. \nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general \npopulation, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically \nrecognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. \n8.2 \nLactation  \nRisk Summary \nIt is not known whether the vaccine components of PRIORIX are excreted in human milk. Data \nare not available to assess the effects of PRIORIX on the breastfed infant or on milk \nproduction/excretion. Studies have shown that lactating postpartum women vaccinated with live \nattenuated rubella vaccine may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed \ninfants.4,5 In the breast-fed infants with serological evidence of rubella virus vaccine strain \nantibodies, none exhibited severe disease; however, one exhibited mild clinical illness typical of \nacquired rubella.6,7 \nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the \nmother’s clinical need for PRIORIX and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from \n \n12\nPRIORIX or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying \nmaternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. \n8.4 \nPediatric Use  \nSafety and effectiveness of PRIORIX in infants younger than 12 months have not been \nestablished.  \n8.5 \nGeriatric Use  \nClinical studies of PRIORIX did not include participants 65 years of age and older to determine \nwhether they respond differently from younger participants. \n11 \nDESCRIPTION  \nPRIORIX (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine, Live) is a suspension for subcutaneous \ninjection. PRIORIX is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized antigen component which is reconstituted \nat the time of use with the accompanying sterile water diluent. The lyophilized antigen \ncomponent is a whitish to slightly pink powder. \nPRIORIX contains the Schwarz strain of live attenuated measles virus, the RIT 4385 strain of \nlive attenuated mumps virus (derived from the Jeryl Lynn strain), both propagated in \nchick-embryo fibroblasts from embryonated eggs of specific pathogen-free flocks and the Wistar \nRA 27/3 strain of live attenuated rubella virus propagated in MRC-5 human diploid cells. The 3 \nvirus strains are cultured in media containing amino acids, a small amount of neomycin sulfate \nand bovine serum albumin and are stabilized after multiple washing steps in media free from \nantibiotics and albumin. The attenuated measles, mumps and rubella viruses are then mixed with \na stabilizer prior to lyophilization. \nAfter reconstitution, each approximately 0.5-mL dose contains not less than 3.4 log10 Cell \nCulture Infective Dose 50% (CCID50) of measles virus, 4.2 log10 CCID50 of mumps virus, and \n3.3 log10 CCID50 of rubella virus. Each dose also contains 32 mg of anhydrous lactose, 9 mg of \nsorbitol, 9 mg of amino acids, and 8 mg of mannitol. Each dose may also contain residual \namounts of neomycin sulphate (≤25 mcg), ovalbumin (≤60 ng), and bovine serum albumin \n(≤50 ng), from the manufacturing process. After reconstitution, PRIORIX is a clear peach- to \nfuchsia pink-colored suspension. \nPRIORIX contains no preservative.  \nThe tip caps of the prefilled syringes of sterile water diluent contain natural rubber latex. \nThe plungers of the syringes and the stoppers of the lyophilized antigen component vials are not \nmade with natural rubber latex. \n \n13\n12 \nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action  \nHumoral immune responses against measles, mumps, and rubella viruses induced by PRIORIX \nwere measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). IgG antibodies measured by \nthe ELISAs used in clinical studies of PRIORIX have been shown to correlate with the presence \nof neutralizing antibodies that have been associated with protection [see Clinical Studies (14)]. \n13 \nNONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \nPRIORIX has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or for impairment of \nfertility. \n14 \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \nThe effectiveness of PRIORIX is based on a comparison of antibody responses relative to \nM-M-R II. Antibody responses to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses were measured by \nELISAs. Analyses evaluated antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMC) and seroresponse \nrates (SRR). Seroresponse thresholds are 200 mIU/mL, 10 ELU/mL, and 10 IU/mL for anti-\nmeasles virus, anti-mumps virus, and anti-rubella virus antibodies, respectively. \n14.1 \nAntibody Responses to Measles, Mumps and Rubella Viruses  \nChildren 12 through 15 Months of Age Who Received PRIORIX as a First Dose \nIn Study 1 (NCT01702428), 5,003 participants 12 through 15 months of age received a first dose \nof PRIORIX (n = 3,714) or M-M-R II (n = 1,289) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Antibody \nresponses to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses were measured by ELISAs using sera obtained \n42 days following the first dose of either PRIORIX or M-M-R II. Non-inferiority of the immune \nresponse after the first dose of PRIORIX compared with M-M-R II was demonstrated in terms of \nSRR and GMC to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses. The immune responses measured in the \nU.S. study participants were similar to those in the overall study population. A summary of \nimmune responses is shown in Table 4. \n \n14\nTable 4.
